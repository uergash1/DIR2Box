FW14-e082-7207-05	Earthquake: Noah Was Not Black	I know who wasn't black -- I don't care what nobody say -- Noah was not black. Noah and his family couldn't have been black 'cause there's no way no black family was on no boat for 40 days and 40 nights and didn't eat them two chickens.
FW14-e082-7207-06	Earthquake: Working for the Cleaners	Best job I ever had was working in the cleaners. That was a good job. I cried like a bitch when they fired me. They fired me for wearing other people's clothes.

FW14-e082-5000-08	Tom Papa: Stuck in Traffic	You ever been on the highway, and your side's just cruising, no problem? The other side is backed up miles and miles in traffic. It's a good feeling, isn't it? I don't even enjoy the guy stuck in the middle as much as the guy who's 10 miles back who...
FW14-e082-5000-09	Jake Johannsen: Vet Instructions	You're supposed to put it on the dog's stitches or his butt. The vet says the dog will not lick the salve because the salve tastes bad to the dog. Hello? He's already licking his ass.

FW14-e082-5003-09	Tom Papa: Cleaning a Man	You can't clean a man with body wash. We need a big brick of soap, hopefully with pieces of rock in it. All mole covered and hairy and not even hair like a nice bear. We're like a sick bear from Chernobyl.
FW14-e082-5003-10	Jake Johannsen: Cult Leader	I never wanted my own cult until I found out about all the perks. Evidently, if you're the cult leader, you can have sex with any of the cult members while the other members have to mow the lawn and wash the dog.
