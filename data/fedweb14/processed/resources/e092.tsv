Eruption! is a volcanic crisis simulation model that showcases a series of villages that surround an active volcano and is part of the Interactive Models for Geological Education Online (IMGEO) series. The goal of the exercise is to preserve as many people and as much property as possible in spite of the threat from the volcano. Students role-play as villagers, the governor, volcanologists, and the press. The rules of the simulation, plus guides for teaching assistants and students, are available on the site. Three different versions are downloadable, for different hardware and classroom situations (e.g. one computer per student, one computer and multiple students a networked environment). The activities in each are modified slightly to reflect the level of computer access for the student. On this Starting Point page, teachers can find learning goals, teaching notes and tips, teaching materials, assessment hints and references and resources dealing with this exercise. It also describes the context in which the virtual tour is best used. (less)

New NASA satellite-generated land cover maps are providing scientists with a detailed picture of the distribution of Earths ecosystems and land use Scientists can better determine how vegetation is distributed and land is being used around the world with new NASA satellite-generated land-cover maps. These new maps, based on a global digital database of land cover types Earth images that is updated every 16 days, will help scientists better understand the Earths climate and carbon budget and climate, through closer monitoring of water and land resources, including forested and agricultural areas. These land-coverland cover maps were developed at Boston University in Boston, MA, using data from the Moderate-resolution Imaging -Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard on NASAs Terra satellite. The prototype MODIS maps were created with data acquired between July and December 2000; but future maps will utilize one year of data. Advances in remote sensing technology allow MODIS to collect higher-quality data than previous sensors, yielding the most detailed land cover classification maps to date. The new maps are better because the quality of MODIS data is much higher than AVHRR data. They are also more current because the information content of MODIS data allowed scientists to exploit more efficient automated methods for categorizing land cover than was were previously possible, reducing the time to generate maps from months or years to about one week. Each MODIS land-coverland cover map contains 17 different land cover types, differentiating among eleven natural vegetation types such as deciduous and evergreen forests, savannas, grasslands, permanent wetlands and shrublands. Agricultural land use , as well as, several categories of land surfaces with little or no plant cover -- such as bare ground, urban areas and permanent snow and ice -- are also depicted in the maps.

By monitoring the color of reflected light via satellite, scientists can determine how successfully plant life is photosynthesizing. A measurement of photosynthesis is essentially a measurement of successful growth, and growth means successful use of ambient carbon. This animation represents the first six years worth of data taken by the SeaWiFS instrument, showing the abundance of life both on land and in the sea. In the ocean, dark blue represents warmer areas where there is little life due to lack of nutrients, and greens and reds represent cooler nutrient-rich areas. The nutrient-rich areas include coastal regions where cold water rises from the sea floor bringing nutrients along and areas at the mouths of rivers where the rivers have brought nutrients into the ocean from the land. On land, green represents areas of abundant plant life, such as forests and grasslands, while tan and white represent areas where plant life is sparse or non-existent, such as the deserts in Africa and the Middle East and snow-cover and ice at the poles.

Students develop research questions with a special focus on the prairie plant population. To answer these questions students conduct a research study collecting data from a prairie plot and comparing their data with data from other native and/or reconstructed prairie plots. Students publish their data and their research study on the SIMply Prairie Website. As the project matures we expect classes will collaborate with other classes on joint research studies. The student data will be available to research scientists who encourage students to take an active interest in preserving and recreating native North American prairies. (less)

Most American students' exposure to the Korean Peninsula begins and ends with the teaching of the Korean War and division along the 38th parallel. The sources and activities here aim to take students beyond the Korean War to explore the divergent stories of North and South Korea and to analyze the causes and effects of each country's unique development. The activities introduce learners to the long-lasting economic and political effects of Korea's division by examining South Korea's rapid industrialization, North Korea's continuing struggle to ensure adequate food for its population, and the arguments for and against reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Working with a photo of a South Korean labor strike, graphs depicting the devastating effects of food shortages in North Korea, and a song calling for reunification, students will gain a better understanding of the peninsula's varied history as well as a greater appreciation for the lived experiences of North and South Koreans at home and abroad.

FW14-e092-7307-07	The Great Political Car and Last Load of Patriots. Dorr, Jackson, Simmons and Arnold!	"A virulent attack on the four conservative Rhode Island legislators who broke ... (more)

A virulent attack on the four conservative Rhode Island legislators who broke with the Law and Order Party to support a Democratic movement to free imprisoned radical Thomas Wilson Dorr. (On the Dorrite Rebellion see also ""Trouble in the Spartan Ranks, Tyrants Prostrate Liberty Triumphant,"" and ""The Four Traitors, Who Most Infamously Sold Themselves,"" nos. 1843-6, 1844-19, and 1845-4). The broadside's text comes from a July 1845 letter from John Whipple, a prominent Providence, R.I., Whig, assailing the ""cold-blooded treachery"" of Charles Jackson, Samuel F. Man, James Fowler Simmons, and Lemuel H. Arnold in their support of the ""liberation"" ticket in the spring elections of 1845. Whipple alleges political opportunism and personal ambition as their motive, and offers a lengthy rebuttal to aspersions cast on his own political character by Lemuel Arnold. He also compares Lemuel Arnold to Revolutionary War traitor Benedict Arnold. The woodcut illustration shows a chariot drawn by Cerberus, the three-headed hound of hell, and by a cow with the head of Thomas Wilson Dorr. Driving the chariot is a bespectacled demon with the legs of a goat. Entwined about his body is a snake, and he wields a whip and a pitchfork. The demon is probably James F. Simmons, who was elected governor on the Democrats' liberation ticket. His tail is grasped by Lemuel Arnold, who sits behind him holding a staff with a banner ""Office."" Behind Arnold sit three other figures: a woman (indicating the prominence of women in the Dorrite cause), a man blowing a horn (another conspirator?), and a uniformed officer, either Napoleon Bonaparte or Benedict Arnold. On the back of the chariot rides a man with a bottle in his pocket, waving a newspaper, the ""Tribune,"" and a stovepipe hat. This may be Horace Greeley, editor of the New York ""Tribune,"" although his usual alignment with the Whigs makes his role here questionable. Below the image are the quotations, ""We stoop to Conquer"" and ""Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven"" (Satan's famous remark from ""Paradise Lost)."" The chariot is decorated with snakes and a shield and anchor with a death's head on the central panel. The unidentified publisher of the broadside adds, in a colophon, ""I have been at considerable trouble, in obtaining a drawing and engraving of ""The Worthies;"" and would particularly inform my friends, that I shall ever consider myself alone, personally, responsible for all that I shall publish . . . ."" Although Marvin Gettleman, in his study of the Dorrite rebellion, dates the broadside March 1845, Whipple clearly states in his letter, ""it is now July.""|Title appears as it is written on the item.|Gettleman, p. 171n.|Published in: American political prints, 1766-1876 / Bernard F.

This protocol represents a cost-effective modification of the Ames Test that allows students to investigate the mutagenic potential of various common substances. Potential mutagens are tested using well-characterized auxotrophic strains of Salmonella typhimurium. By analyzing the results, students determine if any of their compounds may be mutagenic. Follow-up experiments are designed to determine the dose response of these potential mutagens. Using this protocol, we have achieved reproducible results with several known mutagens, including sodium azide and ultraviolet irradiation. This approach enables faculty to control costs and results to improve student understanding of mutagenesis, biochemical pathways, experimental design, and data analysis. (less)

Home to countless species of plant and animal life, the great prairies once spanned millions of acres across North America. Today less than ten percent of the complex ecosystem remains, largely under the protection of parks and nature preserves. In this lesson students will gain an understanding of the interdependence of living organisms on the prairie and the fragility of their existence by investigating life on the prairie and relating their findings to their own experience.

Baseball's growing popularity in the 1920s can be measured by structural and cultural changes that helped transform the game, including the building of commodious new ballparks; the emergence of sports pages in daily urban newspapers; and the enormous popularity of radio broadcasts of baseball games. Baseball commentators and critics expended much ink during the 1920s discussing the exact nature and composition of this new and expanding fan population. Some derided the influx of new fans to urban ballparks, in part because of the growing visibility in the bleachers of the sons and daughters of working-class Italian, Polish, and Jewish immigrants, and in part because the game seemed to be straying from its origins in traditional rural and small-town America. Poet William Carlos Williams evoked the growing diversity of baseball's fans and their impact on the game in ""The Crowd at the Ball Park,"" published in the Dial in 1923. (less)

The Progressive Era's most controversial environmental issue was the 1908-1913 struggle over federal government approval for building the Hetch Hetchy dam in a remote corner of federally-owned land in California's Yosemite National Park. The city of San Francisco, rebuilding after the devastating 1906 earthquake, believed the dam was necessary to meet its burgeoning needs for reliable supplies of water and electricity. At Congressional hearings on Hetch Hetchy held in 1913, supporters of the plan like Gifford Pinchot, the first Chief Forester of the United States and a noted environmentalist, argued that conservation of natural resources was best achieved through management of the wilderness. Preservationist and Sierra Club founder John Muir did not testify before Congress, but he argued against the Hetch Hetchy plan in this excerpt from his 1912 book, The Yosemite. In the end Congress chose management over aesthetics, voting 43-25 (with 29 abstentions) to allow the Hetch Hetchy dam on federal land. (less)

The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Why do some countries grow fast and others fall further behind? Does growth help the poor? Are famines unavoidable? How can we end child labor - or should we? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is micro finance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be ""nasty, brutish and short""? Has globalization been good to the poor? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? (less)

An imaginative and elaborate parody on the upcoming 1844 presidential campaign. The artist favors Whig nominee-apparent Henry Clay and is highly critical of incumbent John Tyler. The ""chase"" for the presidency leads to the White House (upper left) where Robert Tyler arouses his sleeping father saying, ""Come wake up old Sampson, the Philistines are upon you!"" President Tyler replies with a yawn: ""Why Bobby my Pippin! I do believe I've been asleep! no matter I'm the People's favorite and belong to no Party. They will reelect me! If they don't I'll veto the whole concern d--n me!"" His statement and the presence of a ""Veto"" paper on his desk allude to his liberal use of the presidential refusal to stymie Whig congressional efforts to establish a National Bank. In Robert Tyler's pocket is a scroll ""Irish Repeal,"" referring to his support of that international movement. Approaching the steps of the White House, riding a beast which is half-horse and half-alligator (a mythical animal associated in popular lore with Clay's Kentucky), is Henry Clay. He exclaims triumphantly, ""Hurrah! Old Kentuck will distance them all yet, and then the views of the lamented Harrisson will be carried out in full, and treachery will meet its reward."" The sun rises behind him and an eagle with a streamer reading ""E pluribus unum"" flies ahead. Clay is followed by South Carolina Democrat John Calhoun, who remarks, ""My old nullification Coota Turtle is rather a slow Coach! I am afraid he won't get out of this Clay Bank!"" Taking the lower road (in keeping with his reputation for intrigue) is Martin Van Buren, riding a fox and exclaiming, ""Confound Calhoun! He is right in my way! I'll take a short cut and though the path is crooked and rather dirty, I don't care so that I get in."" Van Buren was derisively nicknamed ""the Kinderhook fox."" On the same path are two more presidential aspirants, James K. Polk(?) and Richard M. Johnson. The first, sitting on a donkey and waving a club, yells, ""I'am an Old Soldier, but I shall never get in unless I can turn this Donkeys head the right way."" Johnson, who has fallen off his horse, exclaims, ""My old amalgamation Nag has got the blind staggers! and I can stump it no longer!"" ""Amalgamation"" was common parlance for the melding of races, more specifically referring here to Johnson's common-law marriage and offspring with a mulatto woman, Julia Chinn. Off to the right, Massachusetts senator Daniel Webster sits by an open fire, cooking a cauldron of ""Chowder"" (a staple of his native New England), vowing, ""I shant leave my Chowder! unless my country calls me."" Behind him on horseback is Gen. Winfield Scott who calls over to War of 1812 Commodore Charles Stewart, seated in a boat on a lake, ""Odds bullets and bayonets! I don't care about being President but if my friends insist upon it I'll serve! I say Commodore, cant you or I get in by a Coup-de-main!"" Stewart replies, ""I think not General! so I'll haul my wind! I am better fitted to govern the helm of old Ironsides than the helm of State."" In the lower right corner, a man (possibly Supreme Court Justice John McLean) falls head first down an incline, saying, ""If I thought I had a drop of Democratic blood in my veins I would let it out.""|Entered . . . 1843 by H.R.

This class first offers some basic analytical frameworks -- culture, social structure, and institutions -- that you can use to examine a wide range of political outcomes. We then use these frameworks to understand (1) the relationship between democracy and economic development and (2) the relative centralization of political authority across countries. We will use theoretical arguments and a wide range of case studies to address several questions: Why are some countries democratic and others not? How does democracy affect economic development and political conflict? Why do some countries centralize power while others threaten to fall apart through secession and civil war? We will use examples from a wide range of countries including Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Mexico, and the United States. The lessons drawn from these countries will prepare you to analyze other countries of your own choosing in the paper assignments. At the end of the course, you should be able to analyze political events around the world, drawing on the theoretical explanations provided in the class. (less)

Despite major cultural, legal, and medical impediments the use of birth control, including abortion, by American women was widespread at the turn of the century. In their quest to control unwanted pregnancies, American women could be surprisingly resourceful in the methods they used. In this audio excerpt from a 1974 interview with historian Sherna Gluck, Miriam Allen deFord described methods of birth control in vogue in the 1910s, including spermicides, douches, the Dutch pessary (an early diaphragm), and the use of ergot pills to induce abortion.

Are you teaching freshman level students? Is this one of the first college level courses your students have ever taken? Probably. That is why this English Handbook is different (and we think better).Miles McCrimmon’s, The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers is based on the understanding that writing is at the center of the college experience, not just something students do on their way to “higher-level” coursework.The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers supports the goal of acculturating entering students to the demands of college-level thinking and writing, whether that goal is being met through coursework in Composition, Student Development, or some combination of the two.Miles shows students how to use writing as a portal for thinking and learning and for communicating with the world. Its writing prompts and exercises encourage students to do a great deal of low-stakes, exploratory writing, but also to experience gradually the rhetorical considerations of going public in a variety of genres and media. Through it all, students are asked to reflect on their writing, exploring precisely how it functions depending on the rhetorical considerations of their voice, audience and purpose.The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers is both a guide to college-level writing and thinking and a comprehensive college-level writing handbook. In Part 1, students will identify and develop habits of mind they can use for success in college and life, and in Parts 2-4 and the Appendices, they will find the tools they need to become better and more polished writers.Dig in deeper to the organization to see what we mean:The driving energy of Part 1 (“Composing Habits of Mind”) is the reciprocal relationship between thinking and writing. Students will use low-stakes, personal writing to identify, develop, and activate the habits of mind they need for college-level thinking, then learn how to apply those habits to their high-stakes, public writing. The first three chapters each focus on a different cluster of four related “habits of mind”, while Chapter 4 focuses on the rhetorical demands of demonstrating those habits in the presence of others.Chapter 1 (“Writing to Think and Writing to Learn”) activates the following habits of mind: examining the status quo; posing productive questions; slowing down your thinking; and withholding judgment. Students are exposed to a variety of ways to use low-stakes writing as a gateway to deeper thinking, not so much as a stepping stone toward producing more audience-centered texts, but more as a preliminary, meditative strategy to generate further questions. Habits of mind activated:Chapter 2 (“Becoming a Reflective Practitioner”) activates the following habits of mind: developing a “meta” sense; attending to your own role in observation; reading texts carefully and critically; and nurturing curiosity, wonder, and humor. Students cultivate the “meta” sense as a crucial habit they must acquire and develop in order to succeed as college-level writers, readers, and thinkers. They are also exposed to a variety of methods they can use to reflect productively about themselves, as well as about the texts they encounter and produce.Chapter 3 (“Thinking through the Disciplines”) activates the following habits of mind: seeing and making connections; sustaining two ideas simultaneously; articulating multiple sides of an issue; and finding your place and purpose in the world. Students come to understand that the disciplines they encounter in college, just as the occupations they will someday assume, are socially constructed and negotiated. These disciplines have developed distinct conventions for writing, speaking, and making meaning that are under constant interrogation and revision.Chapter 4 (“Joining the Conversation”) introduces students to what’s involved when low-stakes writing of the type produced in the first three chapters goes public and finds a medium and genre. Systematically, students will explore the rhetorical stakes of writing for an instructor, small peer groups, larger units like an entire class, and still broader audiences outside the confines of the academic setting.The rest of Miles’ handbook has the look and feel of a comprehensive handbook, but with a few crucial differences. Parts 2-4 and Appendix A and B are consistently infused with the principles and habits of mind introduced in Part 1, with exercises designed to reinforce becoming a reflective practitioner, writing to think and learn, thinking through the disciplines, and joining the conversation. The handbook portion also maintains the personable voice of a writing guide established in Part 1, rather than taking on the dry, pedantic tone of a manual. Textboxes, graphics, web links to text, audio and video files, and samples of student work further enliven the handbook portion. Frequent cross-indexing and internal linking between Part 1 and the rest of the book strengthens The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers dual function as a both a writing guide and a comprehensive handbook.We’ve rambled on enough about this handbook, it’s time for you to take a look. Check out the table of contents in the tab above, or request a desk copy and peruse The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers at your leisure. (less)

A satire on dissension and political intrigue within Andrew Jackson's administration, surrounding the Spring 1831 resignations of several members of his Cabinet. In the center Jackson sits in a collapsing chair, labeled ""The Hickory Chair is coming to pieces at last."" Seated on the arm of his chair is a rat with the head of Postmaster General William T. Barry. On the floor before him is a pile of resignations with a broken clay pipe, and a brazier. He sweeps with a broom at a number of rats scurrying at his feet, and in the act knocks over the ""Altar of Reform"" toppling a winged ass also holding a broom. The rats have heads of (from left to right) Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, Secretary of War John H.Eaton, ""D. I. O.""(?), Navy Secretary John Branch, and Treasury Secretary Samuel D. Ingham. John Calhoun is a terrier which menaces the Van Buren rat. Van Buren, threatened by an eagle while attempting to climb the ""Ladder of Political Preferment"" whose rungs are labeled with the names of the states, says, ""If I could only humbug that Eagle and climb up this ladder."" Calhoun: ""You don't get up if I can help it."" Eaton: ""I'm off to the Indians."" Branch: ""This from the greatest and best of men."" Ingham: ""Is this the reward of my Patriotic disinterestedness."" In a doorway marked ""Skool of Reform"" appears a man in a visored cap and fur-trimmed coat saying, ""There's Clay, and this is all Clays doings."" Daniel Webster and Henry Clay (with raised arms) look in through a window. Webster: ""That Terrier has nullified the whole Concern."" Clay: ""Famine! War! Pestilence!""|Cock of the Walk fecit. (Edward Williams Clay).|Entered . . . 1831 by E.W. Clay.|Publd by E.W. Clay, S.E. corner of Walnut and 4th St. Philada.|The print appears to have been derived from William James Hubbard's portrait of Jackson, or from Albert Newsam's 1830 lithograph reproducing the painting. A pencil sketch believed by Davison to be Clay's sketch for the print is in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. The Library's impression of "".0001"" was deposited for copyright on May 5, 1831. Davison also lists a second edition of the print. Two anonymous versions of the print, possibly derived from "".00001,"" were published under the title ""The Rats leaving a falling house.""

In 1927, responding to the seemingly overpowering claims of advertisers and mass marketers, engineer Frederick Schlink and economist Stuart Chase published Your Money's Worth, which argued for an ""extension of the principle of buying goods according to impartial scientific tests rather than according to the fanfare and triumphs of higher salesmanship."" Your Money's Worth became an instant best-seller, and the authors organized Consumers' Research, a testing bureau that provided information and published product tests in a new magazine, Consumers' Research Bulletin. The 1929 stock market crash heightened suspicion of consumer capitalism, and the magazine had 42,000 subscribers by 1932. In 1933, Schlink and Arthur Kallet (executive secretary of Consumers' Research) published 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs: Dangers in Everyday Foods, Drugs, and Cosmetics. The book struck a responsive chord in depression-era America--it went through thirteen printings in its first six months and became one of the best-selling books of the decade. The book's first chapter (""The Great American Guinea Pig""), gave a flavor of their vigorous arguments. (less)
