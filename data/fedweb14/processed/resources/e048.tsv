FW14-e048-7015-09	Ravenous Trivia Free	Ravenous Trivia is a trivia game for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch, based on unusual facts.

One round is all you need to see how fun this game is; we guarantee you’ll be hooked. Challenging Questions Tired of trivia games that are too easy? Most of the questions are based off things you NEVER learn in school meaning that most people can’t get more then half the questions in a round correct! No Repeats We track questions answered to make sure the player won’t see the same question again until they’ve played through every question! Beautiful Graphics The design is sharp, modern and intuitive. Super-smooth animations bring the game to life! Transitions between screens show a slick sliding animation complete with easing.

FW14-e048-7137-10	iPUBQUIZ - Christmas time Quiz	Christmas is fun. Pub quizzes are fun. Put them together and what have you got? That's right. More fun. But of course, Christmas is only fun up to a point. And that's the point about an hour after you've stuffed yourself to the eyeballs with turkey and dozed off in front of Her Maj. And that's where iPubquiz Merry Christmas merrily waltzes in. iPubquiz Merry Christmas is a seasonal variation on iPubquiz, which rocketed into the top ten on Apple's iTunes Games/Trivia category like Santa over the rooftops. Created by the innovative and trusted SunCat Software brand, iPubquiz Merry Christmas is completely FREE! Yep, just when your pockets are empty, we give you a phone-full of free festive fun. Play is as simple and intuitive as munching on a mince pie, and you can compete against other online players by entering your score onto the global scoreboard. Just tap Play on your iPhone and you're straight into the Crimbo-themed game. Which war provides the backdrop to the movie 'Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence'? Who teamed up with Tom Jones to record the '99 Christmas hit 'Baby, it's cold outside'? Choose the right response from the four answers and you'll bag 500 points in your Christmas sack. You'll be rewarded not just for correct answers, but also for speed of response. The more you score, the higher you go up the iTunes scoreboard. If you're struggling, you've got a choice of 50:50 or a Pass. But remember – you've got only three lives. You have three chances on each question and you'll lose points for wrong answers. But the game's only up if you make four wrong guesses. Then, guess what – you just start again. If you love pub quizzes as much as you love Christmas, you'll have a seriously merry time on iPubquiz Merry Christmas. It's the father of all Christmas pub-quiz apps. But be quick – iPubquiz Merry Christmas is available only during the festive season.
