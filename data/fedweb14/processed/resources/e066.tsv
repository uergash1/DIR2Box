FW14-e066-7215-01	Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	... Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer containing squamous cells. Squamous cell carcinomas can be found in many parts of the body including the lungs, skin, anus, esophagus, head and neck areas, and cervix . Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer . It arises from the cells that make the protective keratin of the epidermis (keratinocytes). These cancers can be described based on how differentiated the cells are - well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated. The less differentiated the lesion, the least amount of normal tissue is preserved and the more aggressive the cancer . The appearance of squamous cell carcinoma is more varied than basal cell carcinoma . Squamous cell carcinoma also tends to grow more quickly and can, unlike basal cell, spread to other parts of the body, making it more dangerous than basal cell carcinoma . Those at greatest risk are: Those who have fair complexions and poor tanning capacity (burn eas... ...

Alternative Names Nosocomial pneumonia; Ventilator-associated pneumonia; Health-care associated pneumonia Causes, incidence, and risk factors Pneumonia is a very common illness.

FW14-e066-7197-03	Birth Control Options for Women - Spermicidal and Barrier Contraception	... Spermicidal and Barrier Contraceptives Barrier contraceptives are devices that provide a physical barrier between the sperm and the egg. Examples of barrier contraceptives include the male condom, female condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, and sponge. The condom is the only contraceptive method that helps prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Spermicides Vaginal spermicides are sperm-killing substances available as foams, creams, gels, films, or suppositories, and are often used in female contraception with barrier and other devices. Spermicides are usually available without a prescription or medical examination. The active ingredient in U.S.-made spermicides is usually nonoxynol-9, which attacks the surface of the sperm cell. Nonoxynol-9 does not provide any protection against sexually-transmitted diseases or HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). Research indicates that frequent use can cause vaginal and rectal irritation and abrasions that may actually increase the risk for HIV transmi... ...

Early in the evaluation of a child suspected of a communication disorder, it is necessary to ensure that the child can hear correctly. If the ability to hear is seriously in question in a child, hearing testing with an audiologist could be considered. This may be the only way to identify a subtle deficit in hearing that is causing problems with communication. In addition to hearing deficits, a cleft palate may be the root of a problem with communication. Neurological problems like cerebral palsy, apraxia, and aphasia can also cause problems with speech or language. Mental retardation is also a condition that very commonly results in a problem with communication, and standard tests of intelligence can often be helpful. As ... ...

We really hit it off, but Cathy and I are very different. We're about the same age, but she strikes me more as an artsy intellectual chick who spent the 1980's following the Grateful Dead than a blonde girly girl like me who read Seventeen magazine religiously while listening to the Go Go's at the Country Club pool. I point this out because she doesn't seem like the type of woman who would look to women's magazines for advice--she's too cerebral. Well, several years ago Cathy Alter found herself divorced with all sorts of drama in her life when she decided she needed help. She decided to commit to reading about a dozen women's magazines for a year in hopes of getting her life back on track, and landing a good man.

FW14-e066-7250-06	Maintaining Vascular Health	... Baby Boomers need to understand how to maintain a healthy vascular system as they become seniors. By 2015, the U.S. Census reports an expected 87 million people aged 55 and older, up from 67 million in 2005. Since vascular disease primarily affects seniors, the number of vascular disease cases is expected to rise dramatically. The vascular system is made up of arteries and veins that carry oxygen-rich blood throughout the body to the vital organs, the brains, and the legs. As we age, our arteries tend to thicken with a buildup of plaque and cholesterol, get stiffer, and narrow. When blood flow is restricted, vascular disease like carotid artery disease can lead to stroke; peripheral artery disease can lead to problems walking and in the most advanced cases, foot ulcers, gangrene, and possible amputation; and abdominal aortic aneuryism can result in death if not treated early. These five practices are not new, but with so many people reaching senior status, it is important to reme... ...

FW14-e066-7242-05	Alternative & Conventional Treatments for IBD	"... Ten years ago when my IBD symptoms were at their absolute worst I was desperate. I'd been seeing a gastroenterologist, I'd had all the tests, gotten the diagnosis, and was taking my prescribed medications. But I wasn't really improving - I was still having 10, 20, 30 BMs per day, blood and mucus, and severe pain along with depleted energy, virtually no appetite, and rapid weight loss.   I wasn't angry at my doctor - I liked him, trusted him, and felt he really was doing for me what he knew best to do. But, I also felt that I had to try something else to get my health out of the hole it was in that was slowly getting bigger and deeper every day. At the time, I lived in California and a good friend lived in Prescott, Arizona, near Sedona.

Sometimes it is nothing less than a revolution. More often it is an accumulation of bits and pieces that, when fitted together, begin to make sense, to provide some answers. Even those of us that have the time rarely have the expertise to interpret and integrate all this information in a meaningful way. NAMI has rescued thousands of us.   The education program at the NAMI Annual Convention is superb. Enthusiastic presenters share the latest information in their fields of expertise, laboring hard to do so in a way that lay people will understand. They also make serious efforts to explain how their information relates... ...

FW14-e066-7242-01	The Conventional Convention	...   During my business career, I’ve managed to avoid a great many conventions.   This was much more difficult when I was a featured speaker, but then I employed the ever popular “I must leave right after” tactic.   I would fly in just in time to give my speech and then fly out immediately thereafter.   The above aside, I have nevertheless attended numerous conventions.   Most of these have been what I call a “conventional convention,” tedious and boring.   A few of these have approached the bizarre.   For example, one convention in the mid-summer heat (90F plus) of New Orleans I was booked into a Bourbon Street hotel only to find it had no air conditioning.   About 4:00 a.m., after tossing and turning, and drenched in sweat, it occurred to me that it might be helpful if I rearranged the furniture.   I opened the refrigerator door and pushed the head of my bed up against the doorframe of the refrigerator (which made it impossible for the door to c... ...

FW14-e066-7239-09	Man Talk	... When you first look at a man and a woman, you are able to notice the subtle differences between the sexes.  It is when the two sexes communicate with each other, however, that the differences become truly glaring.  This is because one is speaking “he talk” while the other is speaking “she talk.”   Where this difference really becomes a problem is when you are in a relationship, and you need to know how to combine “he talk” and “she talk” into “we talk.”  So I feel like it's my job as a man and as a dating coach to help all the women learn how to understand “he talk” (or “man talk” as I like to call it), so that they won't need to hire a translator to understand what men are saying.   Women always want men to express their feelings.  They always complain “Why can't he just say he loves me?” or “I wish he would just compliment me more.”   What you ne... ...

And as I review my own writings, I am reminded that we are fortunate to live in such historical times. Manic-depression in the 1900's meant that if you were stricken, you were institutionalized with murderers and the like. It was madness and mayhem as women were often abused by the very ""caregivers"" that were to care for them. Patients were starved, or killed, they were considered worse than thieves ... they were the cast-offs of society.

FW14-e066-7239-03	How I Travel With Rheumatoid Arthritis	"...   ... I get that question a lot, especially from my mother, when I tell her about my upcoming travel itineraries. Then, as though she's saying it for the first time each time, she'll say ""the youth is wasted on the young,"" as though I don't appreciate being young and full of stamina. But, when you have arthritis, ""young"" doesn't necessarily equate to having a lot of stamina. So keeping a game plan when traveling is essential, and someone to remind me (nag?) about that game plan gives me a chance to constantly refine it. My travels take me everywhere, most often to talk to groups of doctors, patients, families and others about arthritis, on behalf of the CreakyJoints community. I'm kind of like a (very hairy) mouthpiece for arthritis - always trying to raise awareness and draw attention to our collective needs. As a result of my hectic schedule, I find myself taking trains, planes and automobiles virtually every week, sometimes multiple times in the span of a few day... ..."

Here is one of my pages: Radiation. Sounds sinister, doesn’t it? Like some KGB plot to eliminate James Bond. A foil-clad beauty cuddles up to 007, then Number One pushes a button and suddenly she’s a super-conductor. Voila! Fried secret agent! My appointment was for 9:00 a.m. Tuesday! So far, everything had been cutting-edge and state of the art. So when they talked about a custom-fitted mold, I expected them to take precise measurements and special-order the perfect, Karen-shaped radiation delivery system. Their ‘system’ turned out to be a can of Kwik Foam and a Hefty trash bag. The tech sprayed the foam in the bag and put it on the table.
