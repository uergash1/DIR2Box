FW14-e083-7146-02	Dirty Joke	"Charlie was visiting an old friend and his wife for dinner. When the time came to leave, his car wouldn't start, and it was too late to call the local service station. 

The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house; there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife taped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. ""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. ""Your husband is my best friend!"" ""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now."" ""I can't believe that,"" Charlie said. ""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? ""Sugar, he certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him."" Charlie did just that. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. 

When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. Again he pulled a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs. 

The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke and muttered: ""Listen, Charlie, old pal, I don't mind you fucking my wife, but for Pete's sake, stop using my ass for a scoreboard!"""

An Irishman drinks at the pub until they close. 

He stands up to leave and falls flat on his face. He tries to stand one more time and falls again. He figures he'll crawl outside and get some fresh air and maybe that will sober him up.

FW14-e083-5013-03	Long Joke	"An Englishman, a German and a Frenchman are all in Saudi Arabia, sharing a smuggled crate of booze when, all of a sudden, Saudi police rush in and arrest them. The mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia, so for the terrible crime of actually being caught consuming the booze, they are all sentenced to death! 

However, after many months and with the help of very good lawyers, they were able to successfully appeal their sentences down to life imprisonment. By a stroke of luck, it was a Saudi national holiday the day their trial finished, and the extremely benevolent Sheikh decided they could be released after receiving just 20 lashes each of the whip. 

As they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheikh announced: ""It's my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping. 

The German was first in line, he thought for a while and then said: ""Please tie a pillow to my back. This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through. When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain. 

The Frenchman was next up. After watching the German in horror he said smugly: ""Please fix two pillows to my back."" But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again and the Frenchman was soon led away whimpering loudly. 

The Englishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: ""You are from a most beautiful part of the world and your culture is one of the finest in the world. For this, you may have two wishes!"" 

""Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful highness,"" the Englishman replied. ""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes."" 

""Not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave,"" the Sheikh said with an admiring look on his face. ""If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish, what is it to be?"" the Sheikh asked. 

The Englishman smiled and said, ""Tie the Frenchman to my back."""

FW14-e083-5016-01	Long Joke	"*How to survive a shark attack* 
1: Don't swim in the ocean. 
Ninety-nine percent of all shark attacks take place in exceptionally large bodies of water also known as oceans. The way to determine if you are currently in an ocean is to taste the water, which should be salty. 

2: Listen out for the music. 
In the event that you are foolish enough to swim in an ocean, listen carefully for the music, as demonstrated in the marvellous documentary film Jaws. All shark attacks are preceded by the ""daah-da , daah-da "" chords, which will gradually become more rapid as the shark gets closer. This is due to the Doppler Effect. 

3: Swim with fat people. 
Try to surround yourself with more appetizing companions. If you know them well, you might even try to switch their suntan lotion with Steak Sauce. This will definitely improve your odds. 

4: Don't go into the water without a knife. 
This is not to defend yourself but to stab the person (a.k.a the decoy) closest to you in the case of a shark attack. Once you are sure the ""decoy"" is bleeding profusely.....swim for your freekin life. 

5: Don't panic. 
In the event that a shark actually bites you, try to remain calm. This really won't help you survive, but everyone else on the beach will appreciate you not shrieking madly, as this is quite unsettling."

Finally the entrance opens, and two men dressed in Pilots' uniforms walk up the aisle. Both are wearing dark glasses, one is using a guide dog, and the other is tapping his way along the aisle with a white cane. 

Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin, but the men enter the cockpit, the door closes, and the engines start up. The passengers begin glancing nervously around, searching for some sign that this is just a little practical joke. None is forthcoming. 

The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and the people sitting in the window seats realize they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport territory. As it begins to look as though the plane will plow into the water, panicked screams fill the cabin. 

At that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the air. The passengers relax and laugh a little sheepishly, and soon all retreat into their magazines, secure in the knowledge that the plane really is in good hands. 

Meanwhile, in the cockpit, the pilot turns to the co-pilot and says, ""You know, Jim one of these days, they're gonna scream too late and we're all gonna die."""

grandma a question if they aren’t 
prepared for the answer. 
In a trial, a Southern small-town 
prosecuting attorney called his first 
witness, a grandmotherly, elderly 
woman to the stand. He approached her 
and asked, ‘Mrs. Jones, do you know 
me?’ She responded, ‘Why, yes, I do 
know you, Mr. Williams. I’ve known you 
since you were a boy, and frankly, 
you’ve been a big disappointment to me. 
You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you 
manipulate people and talk about them 
behind their backs. You think you’re a 
big shot when you haven’t the brains to 
realize you’ll never amount to anything 
more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I 
know you.’ 
The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing 
what else to do, he pointed across the 
room and asked, ‘Mrs. Jones, do you 
know the defense attorney?’ 
She again replied, ‘Why yes, I do. I’ve 
known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He’s lazy, bigoted, and he 
has a drinking problem. He can’t build a 
normal relationship with anyone, and 
his law practice is one of the worst in 
the entire state. Not to mention he 
cheated on his wife with three different 
women. One of them was your wife. 
Yes, I know him.’ 
The defense attorney nearly died. 
The judge asked both counselors to 
approach the bench and, in a very quiet

‘If either of you idiots asks her if she 
knows me, I’ll send you both to the

FW14-e083-5036-01	Long Joke	"*How to survive a shark attack* 
1: Don't swim in the ocean. 
Ninety-nine percent of all shark attacks take place in exceptionally large bodies of water also known as oceans. The way to determine if you are currently in an ocean is to taste the water, which should be salty. 

2: Listen out for the music. 
In the event that you are foolish enough to swim in an ocean, listen carefully for the music, as demonstrated in the marvellous documentary film Jaws. All shark attacks are preceded by the ""daah-da , daah-da "" chords, which will gradually become more rapid as the shark gets closer. This is due to the Doppler Effect. 

3: Swim with fat people. 
Try to surround yourself with more appetizing companions. If you know them well, you might even try to switch their suntan lotion with Steak Sauce. This will definitely improve your odds. 

4: Don't go into the water without a knife. 
This is not to defend yourself but to stab the person (a.k.a the decoy) closest to you in the case of a shark attack. Once you are sure the ""decoy"" is bleeding profusely.....swim for your freekin life. 

5: Don't panic. 
In the event that a shark actually bites you, try to remain calm. This really won't help you survive, but everyone else on the beach will appreciate you not shrieking madly, as this is quite unsettling."

""What's wrong with you?""

God said he was going to give him a companion and it would be a woman. 
He said, ""This person will cook for you and wash your clothes. 
She will always agree with every decision you make. 
She will bear you children and never ask you to get up in the night to take care of them. 
She will not nag, and will be the first to admit she was wrong when you've had a disagreement. 
She will never have a headache, and will freely give you love and compassion whenever needed."" 
Adam asked God, ""What will a woman like this cost?"" 
God said, ""An arm and a leg."" 
Adam said, ""What can I get for just a rib?"" 
The rest is history."

Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. 
At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all. 
That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. ""Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!"" The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down. 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, ""I had no idea you were this religious."" The boy turns, and whispers back, ""I had no idea your father was a pharmacist."""

FW14-e083-5045-04	Long Joke	"A contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? had reached the final plateau. If she answered the next question correctly, she would win the million dollars. If she answered incorrectly, she would pocket only the $32,000 milestone money. 

And as she suspected it would be, the million-dollar question was no pushover. It was, ""Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest, but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it A) the condor; B) the buzzard; C) the cuckoo; or D) the vulture?"" 

The woman was on the spot. She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it. Mainly because the only friend that she knew would be home happened to be a blonde. 

But the contestant had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: ""That's easy. The answer is 'C' -- the cuckoo."" 

The contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, that would seem to be the logical thing to do. 

On the other hand, the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded. 

Time was up. ""I need an answer,"" said Regis. 

Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, ""C) the cuckoo."" 

""Is that your final answer?"" asked Regis. 

""Yes, that is my final answer,"" she said, breaking into a sweat. 

After the usual foot-dragging delay Regis said, ""I regret to inform you that that answer is ... absolutely correct. You are now a millionaire!"" 

Three days later, the contestant hosted a party for her family and friends, including the blonde who had helped her win the million dollars. 

""Jenny, I just do not know how to thank you,"" said the contestant. ""Because of your knowing the answer to that final question, I am now a millionaire. And do you want to know something? It was the assuredness with which you answered the question that convinced me to go with your choice."" 

""You're welcome!"" the blonde said. 

""By the way,"" the winner said, not being able to contain the question anymore. ""How did you happen to know the right answer?"" 

""Oh, come on,"" said the blonde. ""Everybody knows that cuckoos don't build nests. They live in clocks."""

""Listen,"" says the doc, ""I have migraines, too and the advice I'm going to give you isn't really anything I learned in medical school, but it's advice that I've gotten from my own experience. When I have a migraine, I go home, get in a nice hot bathtub, and soak for a while. Then I have my wife sponge me off with the hottest water I can stand, especially around the forehead. This helps a little. Then I get out of the tub, take her into the bedroom, and even if my head is killing me, I force myself to have sex with her. Almost always, the headache is immediately gone. Now, give it a try, and come back and see me in six weeks.""
