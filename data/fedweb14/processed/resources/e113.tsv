FW14-e113-7211-07	"The Basics of Comma UsageThis guide is meant to give you, as a writer, a thorough foundation in comma usage. I won't cover every use, but I will go over a majority of them, all of which are worth knowing. 
As far as this tutorial's subject matter is concerned, I feel comfortable explaining about ninety percent of what follows. However, I want this to be as accurate as possible, so I've gone to other sources online to back me up (primarily to fill in the gaps of my knowledge in terminology). I've included the links to these sources immediately below as well as in the author's description. I will refer to them throughout the tutorial by their source number (Source 1, Source 2, etc). If you wish to better your grammar even further, I particularly recommend grammarbook.com (Sources 2 and 3). Note that all the examples I give in this tutorial were not taken from the sources; they are my own.

Ingredients 
 2 cups flour 
 2 Tbsp. sugar 
 2 Tbsp. baking powder 
 ½ tsp. salt 
 1 tsp. dried basil 
 1 stick butter, cold, cut into tiny pieces 
 ¾ - 1 cup milk 
 Milk, for brushing 
Directions 
Preheat oven to 450F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and dried basil. Cut in the butter until the mixtures looks like smallish bees. Then, mix in the milk. The mixture should be sticky. If too flour-y, add more milk, if too sticky, add a bit more flour. 
On a floured surface, knead the dough until smooth and roll out to about ½ inch thick. Now, with a Halloween, bat shaped cookie cutter, cut out the biscuits. 
Place on prepared baking sheet and brush with the milk. Place into a preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. 
Best served with something like chili.Recipe: Batty Basil Biscuits2 years ago in Editorial

FW14-e113-7211-09	"Writing Lesson: Writing ConversationsWhile I am not a professional by any means, I have been writing for many years and, more recently, beta-reading as well. In all of my experience, I've noticed that a lot of to-be authors make some really silly, simple mistakes. In an effort to help out, I'm going to be putting up a few ""Quick Tips"" that might help you improve your writing and get more readers. 
For this ""Quick Tips"" entry, I'm going to focus on conversation and the use of quotations. Here we go 
Punctuation in Quotations 
When a character is speaking, their statement is often followed by, ""she said"" or, ""he mumbled"". However, you have to keep in mind that this is still part of the sentence! 
Incorrect: ""Wait, I have to tie my shoe."" she said. 
Correct: ""Wait, I have to tie my shoe,"" she said. 
Even though her statement ended, the sentence carried on to tell the reader that it was she who spoke. That's how it works with a period, but with exclamation marks and question marks, many people choose to ignore tWriting Lesson: Writing Conversations2 years ago in Writing

FW14-e113-7211-03	"Punctuating Dialogue: A GuideStandard Punctuation: Dialogue 
Sometimes we read dialogue so often, punctuated in so many different ways, that we either forget what we've learned (if that was anything memorable to begin with) or we rely on instinct to guide us.  A common example of this can be seen in the opening dialogue of darksouldream's piece, Bobby: 
No, replied Cindy `I think his sister Becky is staying with her, but she keeps muttering about parents out living children. The doctors been keeping her pretty sedated. 
Most Americans will cringe at this.  Why?  Well, double quotation marks are the more acceptable usage (the ""traditional convention"") in American Standard English.  However, in British Standard English, both the double quotation mark and single quotation mark are used.  What's the rule?  StylisPunctuating Dialogue: A Guide6 years ago in Editorial

FW14-e113-7211-06	"Punctuation FAQPunctuation FAQ: 
Use period to end strong, stand alone thoughts or as an end for a chain of lines. 
Use a comma for small separation of thought (don't use many periods unless you're going for a stronger, more standout style). 
Use semicolons for more separation than a comma, usually I use the infrequently and in the middle of lines. 
Hyphens are more penetrating than commas (bigger text effect on the page) and can be used to end stand alone thoughts (they have a more linking effect than the period). 
Separate lines with spaces for a complete chain of thought, or separate certain words (usually single words or phrases) for a strong emphasis. 
Use a colon rarely, usually for listing.  Can list thoughts, actions, things, etc. 
Some open poetry is better without punctuation, but I think that most open poetry is flimsy without some structure or form of punctuation.  It must be very compact and flow well to require no punctuation or separation at all.Punctuation FAQ6 years ago in Writing
