Share your food hax.

Stay happier programming by eating good. When you're not in the mood for Cup Ramen and the Dollar Menu at MickyD's.

My favorite relaxer when under stress is Basil Tomato Soup. It really helps me clear my head for more programming. Takes 5-10 minutes to prepare and put in pot. Then forget about it for 40 minutes while it cooks (don't even have to stir).

When I only have 1 minute to microwave something, I make a 1337 Haxor Boca (my own concoqtion). Recipes below.

1) 1337 Haxor Boca

Buy Spicy Chicken Boca Burger at Safeway, some Spicy Hummus, and Pita Bread. Microwave the spicey chicken boca burger for 1 minute. Toast the pita bread if u want to. Cut the pita in half. Cut the boca in half. Put one half of the boca into each pita half. Use a knife and wedge some Spicy Hummus in. Done. Tastes great. Fills you up for 6 hrs. Nothing to clean.

Needs: Box of Spicy Chicken Boca Burger, Pita Bread, Hummus, Microwave

2) Basil Tomato Soup (is this a tuscan thing?):

(Best when you have stale hard bread laying around that you don't want to waste)

Chop 4 garlic cloves into chunks (like the size of rice or bigger). In a saucepot, heat 2 tbsp olive oil on medium. Throw in the garlic. Put a layer of the stale (hopefully not moldy) bread on the bottom. Toast the bread a little in the pot. If you don't have stale bread, throw a handful of rice in instead (abt 2 tbsp). Then put 1 can of whole tomatoes in ($1 from safeway). Canned tomatoes are better than produce section tomatoes because they are easier to use and canned when they're the freshest (food hack!). Put half a can of water in. When it boils. Turn the heat to the low setting. Chop a handful of basil. Throw it in. Come back in 40 minutes for something great. Add salt to taste.

Needs: Can of whole tomatoes, Basil, Garlic, Stale Bread, Olive Oil, a Stove.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the type of skin cancer. It increment is directly dependent on our age because as the person get more and more exposure to harmful UV rays it causes more skin damage.

Hazard perception element in DSA driving theory test -

Hazard perception test forms a second section of the theory test and must be passed at the same time. Integrating theoretical hazard perception test training into the practical training sessions will ensure that as competence is achieved in each of the necessary skills, they can be strengthened and applied while you are on the road to increase the road safety benefits.

If you follow good driving practices you can avoid potentially dangerous situations while driving. Hazard percpetion test more information can be gathered here online http://www.theory-test.co.uk/asp/hpt_flashdisplay.asp

THINK road safety advice to keep everyone safer on the UK urban roads -

Why speeding is a bad idea

Deciding what speed to drive at is a continuous process and can be a difficult judgement to make. THINK! has put together some tips to raise drivers' awareness of the dangers of driving too fast.

Driving too fast is bad driving

Drivers rightly think things like poor lane discipline (e.g: not getting into the right lane before a turn-off or roundabout, or failing to keep to the left when not overtaking on motorways and dual carriageways), failure to signal and driving too close are examples of poor driving.

Excessive speed is a criminal offence

""Excessive speed"" means going over the speed limit. Doing this is a criminal offence and, if you're caught, it's likely to result in a fine and penalty points on your licence. In most cases, you'll get a standard fine and licence endorsement. But more serious cases may result in you being taken to court.

Inappropriate speed is too fast

You don't have to be driving over the speed limit to be driving too fast. ""Inappropriate speed"" means driving within the speed limit, but too fast for the road and traffic conditions. It includes approaching a bend or junction too fast, not negotiating narrow roads properly and overtaking where it's inappropriate.

Inappropriate speed can also be a factor in poor weather conditions and when driving at night. Choosing the appropriate speed is about judgement, most people think they get it right. Sadly, the statistics show many get it wrong.

Follow the advice, make yourself aware of the potential driving hazards and you can be safer driver of the roads.

About hazard perception test

New drivers are involved in accidents, especially in the first months after passing a driving test. It has been proven that drivers who have taken hazard perception test training have much better hazard perception test skills.

Are you preparing for UK DSA driving theory test?

Looking for advice on getting the most out of the city from a startup perspective.

My co-founder and I are coming from London as part of http://www.ldn2sfo.com/ . That aims to give us a whirlwind lowdown on how SV and SF operate, and a very high-level view of where a few startups and VCs are located.

We'd love to get a somewhat deeper view and with a view to working our backsides off and growing our bootstrapped company into one that requires a US entity within a year, we want to get a good sense of how SF can be done bootstrapped or at least affordably (even from a London perspective the salaries, rent, etc look crazy high from here).

At the very basic end there are just trip logistics: Recommend an AirBNB to use as a base, or a garage to sleep in, ideally owned by someone on HN and with a good internet connection (we work when we have moments spare).

At the other end there's a more general: If you were coming to San Francisco and Silicon Valley for the first time and for a week or so and wanted to get the most out of it, what do you wish someone had told you?

Basic goal: Figure out how SF/SV works from a startup perspective, build a network of contacts that might grow into friendships that could offer support in the future, and on the dream list would be to also build a few connects with VCs who might later become investors.

So in the most vague Ask HN ever, what would you share with a UK startup coming to San Francisco?

FW14-e110-7242-01	Ask YC: How to avoid front-end clutter?	"7 points

by robertgaal

6 years ago

7 comments Follow

I suppose most front-end developers/designers heard of this problem before: too much CSS and Javascript files and too much declarations in 'em. After a while it gets hard to find your way around all the classes in there and add or fix things. Next to that you might scratch certain server-side code and forget to update the client-side bits. We tried to fix this by creating a lot of different CSS/JS files but sometimes certain declarations span across different site sections and you end up looking for them in the wrong place anyway.

How do you guys combat the mess you automatically make in the front-end? Do you use frameworks like Blueprint or perhaps SASS? I still haven't found any structure or convention that kind of forces me to do it DRY and neat, like for instance RoR has done for me. Maybe it's time to create a standard for this, or just to create some naming pattern to map front-end code to server-side? Or maybe that already exists?

Any thoughts?

(I hope I didn't explain this too vague, I'm trying hard not to)

Yesterday I signed up for a new account on twitter using a third party browser(no active logins,incognito mode) on my phone. I used a new unused Gmail email id and selected a very vague twitter handle.

After completing signup the top two handles twitter recommended that I follow belonged to family members.

I was using the internet connection at home, which seems to be the only possible common link. It seems twitter uses ip addresses to track users. The accuracy disturbs me because I am pretty sure my dynamic home ip address resets a few times a day. Or perhaps twitter uses some other factors too but I cannot think of any other common points. My user agent,cookies and email id couldn't have linked me to my family members. Any thoughts? I was using my phone and my cellular data was on but since wifi was on it is preferred. My cellular carrier's website identifies my phone number but I doubt it would share my phone number with third party websites like twitter.

Social media seems to be a hot topic but with a lot of tension from two aspects:

(1) There is a lot of talk about developing and delivering more in social media. The more might be from things new in each of data sources, data manipulation techniques, Web sites, or companies. There might be more in just the content or in social search to find such content.

(2) There is not much clarity about just how to have more in social media or just why to have it. For the ""why"", what users want it, and what would they do with it?

Here are two examples of some of the recent talk about social media:

First, here on HN is the thread:

""Sergey Brin: We’ve Touched 1 Percent Of What Social Search Can Be (techcrunch.com)""

at

http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/20/sergey-brin-weve-touched-1-percent-of-what-social-search-can-be/

Second, is the thread ""Building Better Social Graphs"" at Fred Wilsons blog A VC* at:

http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/01/building-better-social-graphs.html#disqus_thread

with a lot of relatively good relevant comments.

So, let's dig in a little: We can start with being more clear about our terminology. There are three terms:

(1) Social Graph:

So, in applied math, the relevant definition of a graph is a collection of arcs and nodes with each node much like a geometric point and each arc a connection between two nodes (usually distinct but sometimes the same). An arc may be directed or not: A directed arc is drawn with an arrowhead and is regarded as a one-way street.

In a social graph, each node is likely a person (or maybe the blog of a person) but might be a group of people. The people might be users of Facebook, Twitter, etc. or just people who don't use the Internet. Then an arc might represent friend on Facebook, a follower on Twitter, or some such.

(2) Social Media:

Examples would include Facebook, Twitter, etc., maybe even HN. Maybe a definition of social media would be some Web site where people interact.

(3) Social Search:

Given data from social graphs and/or social media, one could do searches of that data.

To continue: There can be a problem with the concept of a social graph: Too commonly it is left unclear just what the arcs mean!

So, consider a person's social graph: They may have an arc to each person (A) they went to high school with, (B) live on the same street as, (C) went to college with, (D) dated, (E) married, (F) worked at the same company as, (G) hired to plow snow from their driveway, (H) got their business card at a Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, etc. So, the point of these examples is that there is enormous variety on what the arcs can mean.

So, to make progress, maybe usually we should be more clear on what the arcs mean!

Now to something more substantive:

In Fred Wilson's thread ""Building Better Social Graphs"", there were two strikingly different themes:

First, Wilson started the thread with a post where he wanted to be able to download each of his social graphs and then curate them himself.

Second, in the comments, the theme was strong that given the data on the social graphs, we should have computer-based means to process the data for curation, etc. Curiously, the goal of this processing was Wilson's ""Building Better Social Graphs"" by stronger means than just Wilson's manual curation! That is, Wilson's title was stronger than Wilson's post, and the comments were closer to the title than the post was!

So, from 40,000 feet up, it appears that many people have some vague, ill-defined, intuitive, poorly identified and articulated visions of making progress with social graphs. Each of the broad subject of social, Facebook, Twitter, and the Internet, is so big that we should take the visions, as crude as they are, seriously.

So, there are a lot of people (e.g., 500+ million users of Facebook, etc.); each such person has one or more social graphs; somehow there should be some value in that data; we might process the data automatically to obtain some useful results; and the data might be good for doing related searching. Yes, for an ad supported Web site, the data might also be good for ad targeting!

Again, we should not miss the likely importance: From higher than 40,000 feet up, for people, networking has long been very important. E.g., about 120 years ago, some wealthy families built some large, expensive houses in Newport, RI. Why? So, in the summers the wives could hold big parties, network, and have their daughters meet good (i.e., mostly just wealthy) husband candidates! Sometimes even the husbands would get on a private railroad car in Manhattan, ride up to Newport, and show up at the party for a few minutes before going upstairs to read a book or play poker with the other bored husbands! E.g., in careers, long a common remark has been, ""It's not what you know but who you know."". Well, the Internet is the biggest network of them all; it can in effect reduce geographic distances to zero; it has the power of computers and software to process data, and it might become much more important than anything before in ""who you know"", etc.

Descending a little from 40,000 feet, and thinking about what software we might write, we can identify three important issues:

(1) Meaning.

An arc in a graph from the definition in applied math has essentially no meaning in any sense social or even practical. So, if we are to make use of data from social graphs, etc., then we should make some progress, if only rough, on what the arcs, or other data, mean.

(2) Purpose.

We should identify the purpose of the software. That is, what will be the output of the software, and why will users like that output? Or, what do users want, or at least would like if they saw it, that such software might provide? What the heck is the darned purpose?

We might start by articulating just what is the purpose of Facebook, Twitter, etc.! The original purpose of Facebook at Harvard was to get dates. For Twitter, maybe the purpose is to follow selected other people and, maybe, ingratiate oneself.

(3) Techniques.

Given the data, what data manipulation techniques will we have the software use to get the results good for the purposes?

I raise one more point:

The US has something over 300 million people. In some important respects, this number is not very large. E.g., it is easy enough for current computing and data base techniques to have, say, 1 million bytes on each person and still be able to store and process that data.

So, it can appear that there is a chance that we could have a single, grand solution in the space of social graphs and social search. If so, then we will guess that the present efforts in social media are only tangential or indirect solutions for a central problem not yet identified, articulated, or solved and that a single, grand solution might be possible.

So, consider roughly 1 million bytes on each person in the US. It turns out, although not discussed very openly, actually there are data bases that have a lot of data on nearly every adult in the US. So at least in principle, there is a lot of data now. Keeping this data restricted in walled gardens forever may be unreasonable.

Here is a simple example: Just take the printed phone books, type in the data (or get a DVD from someone), and sort the data on state, city, and street address. Then, given a person and their street address, a simple data base query will yield the names and telephone numbers of all of that person's neighbors. In particular, such a telephone book can provide a case of a social graph for each person in the book.

When this person makes a telephone call, the telephone records provide another social graph for this person. When this person uses a credit card, we get another social graph. Each merchant who accepts a credit card defines a social graph.

Net, our society is awash in data for social graphs from sources much more general than Facebook, Twitter, etc.

So, generally we can guess that we can approach asymptotically 1 million bytes of data on each person in the US where this data provides a fairly complete description of that person.

So, we have potentially a grand answer to the issue what data.

Then we can move on to what purposes? What will people what to do with this data?

Okay, in some broad sense, many of the uses will be introductions. Or, ""I see that you also bought a Golden Retriever puppy at the North Hills Mall Puppy Store and also have a son in the third grade at North Side Grade School."" Uh, nearly anyone else could devise better purpose scenarios that that!

So, for introductions, there already is an industry, that is, romantic matchmaking. So, introduction can be for more purposes than just romantic, and likely both the data and the processing techniques used could be quite similar.

So, from 40,000 feet up, the purpose of social anything and of social search may be introductions that could be accomplished by starting with available data and processing it much as in current romantic matchmaking services.

Yes, the introductions could be for many purposes -- hobbies, careers, looking for a supplier, customer, employer, employee, date, spouse, cello in a string quartet, etc.

At times in the comments on the Fred Wilson thread, it appeared that one of the purposes was just the usual one of some women just wanting to meet with, get to know, and gossip with as many other people as possible, for no definite reason! That is, we have to accept that one of the purposes may be just to 'meet' people for no other definite purpose!

So, where am I going wrong?

What more is there to be said?

Where can we be more clear on the data, purposes, processing, and future of social whatever via the Internet?

Hello world!

I'm not exactly sure the right way to approach this, I've never been much for doing things in an orthodox way, so I'll just be straightforward about it. I need to find an investor.

I believe that I have all of the necessary ingredients to be successful at what I'm trying to accomplish, but I realize that I need others to believe in me to help me to achieve my potential; few people ever get there alone.

I hear prominent figures say that they invest in the people more than the ideas and I wonder how true that is. Do you care more about me or my actual startup? In this case I think both are awesome, so maybe it's your lucky day (or mine).

So, yes, I've got a startup. That's a lie, I've got two startups, but one is my baby. We'll get back to that later, for now I want to talk about who I am and why I am writing this.

Maybe I suffer from the DunningKruger effect, but I think I might be just the right mix of crazy, creative, and calculated to accomplish something fairly impressive.

I'm a developer / programmer / sysadmin / hacker with a pretty impressive skill set, but I also have an artistic sense and graphic design background. I'm also very well read in literature, science, and philosophy and am possessed by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and experience. I am equally exposed to the arts and sciences.

I probably don't look very good on paper. In fact, I probably look pretty bad on paper. When I was slightly younger (and quite a bit more stupid) I would have conjured up some inspired sophistry to explain away my mistakes, or I would have tried to blame my lousy circumstances on someone else, but I'm past that kind of nonsense now. I'm old enough to know better. Not too old, though. I'm three years younger than Jack Dorsey and three years older than Mark Zuckerberg, so I think I'm sitting in a cultural sweet spot. I'm wise enough to accept that don't know everything, but experienced enough to trust myself when it counts. I'm confident in my judgment and abilities, but not to the point of arrogance and closed-mindedness. I've read that fools surround themselves with idiots so that they will feel superiority, but the clever surround themselves with the wise so that they gain wisdom. That's not a useless maxim if you ask me.

Paul Graham said: ""So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.""

That's me. Of course, there are a million people who fit that description. Who am I kidding? Probably a few million...

So why me? Why am I worth someone's time and resources? Great question. Let's start at the beginning.

As I led with, I probably don't look very good on paper. Based on what the ""paper"" trail says, I come off as a bad bet. I owe some personal debts, my credit isn't exactly superb, and there are a few other little complications I'll be happy to elaborate on if your curiosity can't contain itself by the time you finish reading this message in a bottle.

Where were we? Oh yes, I'm a bad bet. Not a confidence inspiring statement, I'm aware, so let's fix that.

Seabiscuit was a bad bet, too, and that's me... I'm Seabiscuit. One day I'm limping along looking pathetic and broken and you think I'll never walk again, much less race. Yet, here I am, running... fast.

I've made some less-than-stellar choices in the past, but I've learned incredibly valuable lessons from those mistakes. They were always born out of emotion, confusion, or desperation; never out of malice, spite, or envy. They unexceptionally occurred whenever I was following my heart instead of my head, as I was always encouraged to do as a child. I've learned that I need to take more precise and calculated risks and follow my intuition rather than take wild risks and follow my desire. That's all very vague and ambiguous, I know, but it's important for me to convey that I am somewhat self-actualized in that regard. I'm at peace with where I stand and I am a forward-thinking person; it's an important characteristic of who I've become and who I intend to continue being.

Most of my issues were always self-induced, such as quitting jobs that I couldn't stand even when it wasn't a financially stable thing to do, or spiraling out of control when a relationship would end and then relinquishing any shared assets, bank accounts, vehicle, etc, or running away from home as a teenager. I would always respond to situations without proper emotional intelligence, a skill I've acquired and begun to master in recent years. I've also developed an incredibly humanistic and empathetic side as my emotions have matured.

My repeated and intentional detachment from material possessions coupled with my inability to submit to the complacency of ""the norm"" and a regular job has only fueled my creative and entrepreneurial spirits. I don't have a burning desire to fill my pockets with dollar bills, but a fire does rage inside to build a successful business and to, as Paul Graham put it, ""solve the money problem"". Which brings us to ambition and motivation...

Why do I want financial flexibility? Why do I need money if I don't care about things? Why am I writing this? Why am I driven? How driven am I?

Good questions.

I want to enjoy my life. I want to help others. I want to do something with my life, something positive. I want to leave something in the world that wasn't here when I arrived. I want to contribute and make a difference. I want to do something that matters.

I have a family (not a wife and kids or anything, but immediate family, parents, sisters, brother, nieces and nephews) who really need some help and breaks in their lives. I've done all I can to help them at every turn, given my parents money that I simply did not have, given up my rent to help them keep food on the table and pay heating bills, etc. I've supported them as much as I can when I've been thriving, but I've always been torn between keeping a job that destroys my soul just to provide some help vs. trying to succeed on a larger scale and making things easier in the long run rather than day-to-day. I won't go into the details of my various family concerns (health problems and bills, lack of economic opportunities, etc) but I have more than enough reasons to push myself to the limit. It consumes me that they are not taken care of and that they struggle the way that they do. I must help. I know now that what I need to do is live as close to the metal as I can for now and put off helping them as much as I can until I am financially secure. This means building my company and resolving my personal financial issues so that I can focus on my work without financial stress and distractions.

I have a tremendous work ethic that I wish could be applied to something I really care about.

I am tired of worrying about how I will survive and how I will make enough money to take care of everything and still find time to work on my businesses. I want to know that what I'm supposed to be focusing on is my business.

My biggest downfall in pursuit of that goal has been that I've never really tried wholeheartedly at anything worth doing. I don't mean that I haven't put enormous amounts effort into things, because I've definitely done that (studying, learning, programming, art, music, reading, preparing myself, etc), but I've never before had something that I cared so much about that I actually wanted to (or have been able to) devote all of my time to making it grow and succeed. I've wanted to have something that I was that passionate about, but I always found myself busy working on someone else's project or at someone else's company, usually doing something that disagreed with my personal philosophies and tastes. I'd quickly burn out and become uninspired and leave behind the mind-killer to go dive into my own creative development (music, writing, code, etc). I've had ideas, companies, little startups here and there, but nothing I ever had the time and resources to really make succeed. I've never been able to find someone who can get as excited as I can about something and then believe enough in it to actually follow through and manifest the idea. I finally have that now. I need to be able to build upon my existing product and I need to be able to get good people involved.

I very recently ended a 5-year relationship and for the first time have had an appropriate emotional response to the situation. I've focused on my work, my clients, my own companies, my networks and relationships and the outcome has been very positive. I am now completely free of being tied down to a particular place and I am no longer subject to normal relationship distractions. ALL OF MY TIME CAN FINALLY BE DEDICATED TO MY COMPANY AND I AM READY TO DO THAT. I CAN FOCUS COMPLETELY ON BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AND AM VERY MOTIVATED TO DO SO! I have so much built up passion ready to let loose it is unreal. I am ready to pour myself into this.

I have a myriad of clients that I consult and develop for (government and commercial), I am part of a great open source development team, I have two startups of my own, and was just offered the CTO and lead developer position at a funded startup that is building a mobile gaming platform. I want to work on my own projects, but some of the other opportunities are making it too lucrative not to consider them. If I go that route I will be falling right back into working on someone else's dream instead of mine. I don't want to do that again.

I have been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. I started on my first paper route when I was 10 years old. I woke up at 3 a.m. every day before school and on the weekends to stuff and wrap over 200 newspapers to deliver all over the small midwestern town I grew up in. I delivered newspapers before and after school for 5 years, through all kinds of weather, reading the newspaper every day as I delivered it. I was responsible for purchasing newspapers from the publishers, collecting payments from my customers, and handling the financial balancing act. There was once a contest to sell newspaper subscriptions all over the area that I lived in. The winner was awarded a $200 gift certificate to the a mall in addition to being entered into the ""Newspaper Carrier Of The Year"" competition. I sold 200+ subscriptions all over the region and won the contest.

In high school I started my first web company with two other students while I was already working at a web consulting firm as a developer after school and on the weekends and also at the technology services center for the school district I attended.

After high school I moved to California and joined as the CTO of a startup hosting company that also gave me equity, but because of a bad business deal and trusting the wrong friend I didn't receive any financial payout when the company was sold. Lesson learned about people, business, money, and contracts.

After that experience I bounced around a few companies, usually clashing with the people who ran the place because their goals never corresponded with mine. Most places I worked were stagnant and comfortable and inspired no ambition, drive, or loyalty. They were jobs. I am not a job person. They always lacked culture. I am a work person, just not a job person.

I caused a little trouble in my 20s, learned a lot of life lessons, opened my eyes and ears and started to grow up.

I've spent the last 3 and a half years building two companies, one on top of the other. One is a PAAS (Platform as a Service) and the other is a typical kind of startup (built on top of the PAAS), but it's the one I'm most excited about and have put the most effort into. It's fully developed far past prototype, has users, but is stealth-ish at the moment. I have an amazing network of people ready to help me and promote it and develop it further. I have a vision and high standards and want to do so much more with it than is already built but lack the resources. I keep seeing companies get ridiculous amounts of funding or being purchased for huge sums; I don't need anything close to those numbers! I don't know how some of these people can blow throughs o much money and have so little to show for it. It baffles me.

So... here I am.

I'd rather not spend my days making tedious changes to minutia at the request of clients and bosses. I'd rather do something interesting that inspires me to solves problems using creativity with a group of clever and awesome people.

I consult nearly full-time right now and spend my other waking hours working on my open source projects and my own companies, often skipping sleep. I want to spend much more time on my own stuff, but that's simply not possible when I have to worry about my financial situation and do work for others.

I don't want a mansion or a yacht, I just want to work on positive things, take care of my family, build more things, and make a difference.

I have my finger on the pulse of culture, business, industry, art, society, and a lot of other things. I read Hacker News and read and watch everything I possibly can that might give me helpful insights.

I keep seeing how being a risk taker with a mind of your own is a big plus for founders. Well, look no further. I saw what Peter Thiel said about ""Founder as Victim, Founder as God"".

I'm passionate, motivated, capable, aware, insightful, open-minded and eager.

I know the Silicon Valley names, I know who the big players are, who the go to guys are, but I'm not sure that's the game I want to play.

I own 100% of one of my startups and 50% of the other (the more exciting one). The other founder (non-technical) is open to a buyout, although I don't have the resources to do that myself. They are also willing to stay involved under the right circumstances. I'd prefer to run things completely autonomously, but I'm flexible. The other founder is willing to let me make all creative, technical, and financial decisions; they only want their ownership for now (unless I can buy them out). The company is incorporated in Delaware and is in good standing and is set up as a California foreign corporation. The company name / domain name is trademarked and the concept and execution are quite good. We've been offered a somewhat reasonable investment a couple of times, but I wasn't happy with the conditions. I completely believe in the idea, the execution, and the possibility of its success, now it's time for me to find someone else who does too.

Hopefully I will find someone who can appreciate that while I have a vision and a goal, I lack some of the more annoying pretenses. I don't feel entitled to anything.

If you want to know the specifics of my companies and have an interest in possibly getting involved with me in some capacity (even just to give me advice or ask questions) then respond to me and I'll send you the details. You can email me privately at angelheaded@yahoo.com (I created an account just for this)

I'll also send along a more detailed summary of my own skills and experience.

I'm not looking for someone who wants to see what my companies are and then go talk about them on the internet or something just yet, I'm looking for someone serious to get involved and provide what I need to help me continue to build something real and substantial that we can both benefit from.

For once in my life I would like to not have to worry so much about things that I care so little about.

Bet on Seabiscuit, he's going to win this race. I do not give up.

\----------

""If""

If you can keep your head when all about you

Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

But make allowance for their doubting too;

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,

Or being hated, don't give way to hating,

And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;

If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

And treat those two impostors just the same;

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

\--

If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

To serve your turn long after they are gone,

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

\--

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,

if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,

Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,

And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

Should there be a standard rating of conference talks? Should events advise attendees of content that might take a talk beyond a U rate? The bellow rating systems are those of British Board of Film Classification and used for film, videos an games ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk ).

U: Suitable for all \- No discriminatory language or behaviour unless clearly disapproved of. \- No references to illegal drugs or drug misuse unless they are infrequent and innocuous, or there is a clear educational purpose or anti-drug message suitable for young children. \- Scary sequences should be mild, brief and unlikely to cause undue anxiety to young children. The outcome should be reassuring. \- Infrequent use only of very mild bad language. \- Occasional natural nudity, with no sexual context. \- Mild sexual behaviour (for example, kissing) and references only (for example, to making love).

12: Suitable for 12 years and over \- Discriminatory language or behaviour must not be endorsed by the work as a whole. Aggressive discriminatory language or behaviour is unlikely to be acceptable unless clearly condemned. \- Any misuse of drugs must be infrequent and should not be glamorised or give instructional detail. \- Moderate language is allowed. The use of strong language (for example, fuck) must be infrequent. \- Nudity is allowed, but in a sexual context must be brief and discreet. \- Sexual activity may be briefly and discreetly portrayed. Sex references should not go beyond what is suitable for young teenagers. Frequent crude references are unlikely to be acceptable.

18: Suitable only for adults In line with the consistent findings of the BBFCs public consultations and The Human Rights Act 1998, at 18 the BBFCs guideline concerns will not normally override the principle that adults should be free to choose their own entertainment. Exceptions are most likely in the following areas:

\- where material or treatment appears to the BBFC to risk harm to individuals or, through their behaviour, to society for example, any detailed portrayal of violent or dangerous acts, or of illegal drug use, which may cause harm to public health or morals. This may include portrayals of sexual or sexualised violence which might, for example, eroticise or endorse sexual assault

Dear HN friends,

Please help me with ideas/activities to do in the Silicon Valley and Boston area. It has been two years since I've had a proper vacation, and I'd like to invest my time wisely. I created an editable document listing the objectives below: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhDkdt6AP4f9M58DSQ3ZHYeKlxArsGGn7kCIWMJlbCs/edit

I'm an aspiring entrepreneur/maker from Saudi Arabia, 28 years old, unmarried. I'm a pretty good software developer (on the side) but I work in business development (running the coolest business incubator in the country!). I'm looking for things to do within the realm of entrepreneurship, product development, design, art, and software development.

I don't mind working for ultra-cool studios/shops/places/individuals for a week or so. I can offer fast-paced software development skills and mediocre business development insight. I am well-rounded and very curious. I would consider this journey a success if I 1) learn new things and 2) network with the right people.

I am also considering the idea of building a product in 30 days in SV and then go to China for the last 10 days to mass produce - got nothing to loose, why not try? I will evaluate this based on my options.

Thanks, A. Naimi http://anaimi.com (blog) http://burkanlabs.com (part-time startup) http://twitter/anaimi

FW14-e110-7293-10	Ask HN: Chicken and egg problem in a community startup with a slow velocity?	"5 points

by dbingham

3 years ago

2 comments Follow

Here is my startup, Fridge to Food. It is crowd sourcing for recipes: http://www.fridgetofood.com

A couple of months ago I posted this and got great feedback. I've been through quite a few iterations since then and have what is now a site that is minimally feature complete. I'm beginning to work on the more advanced reputation dependent features, but have a bit of a chicken and egg problem with the community. I have about 150 users, of whom some 20 maybe visit on a regular basis. And a handful post recipes on a regular basis. The site has a pretty slow velocity, because even the most dedicated users only have recipes to post a few times a month.

The issue I'm facing is that I'll need enough of a community to test the reputation dependent features when I implemented them. And I don't really have that right now. Unless I make the reputation threshold incredibly low, which beats the point.

So I'm facing the classic community based chicken and egg problem. I've pretty much mined my solid connection network out. The ones who cook regularly already use my site. The ones who don't, well, don't. I've been working pretty hard on Twitter and the various food-based subreddits to try and draw in some new early adopter users. But I've experienced limited success with that. Those who comment love it, and join. But the slow velocity often prevents them from doing much before forgetting about it. I've been trying to build connections with food bloggers, however, that is slow going. I'm not naturally a marketer type, so I have to spend a great deal of effort doing that. And it takes time away from writing code. I've considered cold e-mailing bloggers with a basically canned e-mail, but haven't tried it much. And when I have, I experienced pretty limited success there too.

So how can I solve the chicken and egg problem? People seem to love the concept of my site, and like the implementation. But the slow velocity and small community is preventing me from... well building a big enough community to have a higher velocity. Also, I'm having trouble just finding ways to get the link to it out there. Despite being pretty active on reddit and twitter I've only garnered about 3,000 unique views in about 1 month and a half. What are some other places I can put it out there?

I need to learn some PHP after several years of serious hacking in Ruby. Of all Ruby books I've read ""The Ruby Way"" by Hal Fulton was the most practical and fun to follow. For example, while telling you about basic data structures it would also give you a recipe for implementing a sparse matrix or how to use arrays as mathematical sets.

What is the best book that focuses on PHP as a programming language, rather than on building websites?

FW14-e110-7293-05	Recipe: Easy to remember, service specific and secure passwords	"4 points

by torstesu

3 years ago

6 comments Follow

People, even tech-savvy ones, have a tendency to use a single or a low multiple of different passwords for different services, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.

The challenge is how to make strong, service specific passwords which are easy to remember. Here is a recipe:

1\. Construct a complex password key with a minimum length of 8 characters, e.g -Kr/2.pq4. 
2\. Make an algorithm based on the URL. E.g. news.ycombinator.com

FW14-e110-7293-04	Ask HN: Review my startup - YumTab, universal recipe box, Delicious replacement	"14 points

by jkkramer

YumTab started as a weekend project to help my girlfriend and I manage recipes we found online and cooked. Many weekends and week nights later, YumTab is close to where I want it to be.

http://yumtab.com/

It's a universal recipe box that saves recipe bookmarks along with things like ingredients, which get extracted from the page automatically. It also has a basic planner, shopping list, and sharing features.

Existing solutions were inadequate. There are a few ""universal recipe box"" / recipe bookmarking sites out there, but they all suffer from one or more of: restricted site support, need to copy & paste ingredients manually, or cumbersome, ad-riddled interface.

I tried to focus on making YumTab a useful complement to recipe sites for actual cooks, rather than just another source of food porn (not that there's anything wrong with that -- there's just plenty of good solutions already).

The homepage design has gone through many iterations. Comments about that would be appreciated.

I'm more coder than hustler at this point, so promotion & monetization suggestions welcome. I've considered requiring one-time payments, a la pinboard.in (maybe with a free limit of 100 recipes or so) but I'm not sure how well that would work. I'd like to avoid plastering the site with ads.

FYI, it uses PHP on the frontend and Clojure on the backend.

Thank you!

I've always been big into cooking and when the iPad came out I figured it would be the perfect replacement for the massive stack of printed recipes I had collected over the years.

But after trying out the iPad recipe apps in the store, I realized that most of them did not allow you to enter your own recipes, and the ones that did were incredibly cumbersome to use. (E.g. having to enter recipes from an external website, or having to fill out 24 fields to get a single recipe entered.)

So the idea for Paprika Recipe Manager was born, and a few months later, it is now available in the App Store.

The basic premise of Paprika is basically an Instapaper for recipes. It comes with a built in web browser that lets you save recipes from the web. (Which is mostly how I discover my new recipes.)

We designed the app to be as simple as possible to create and save recipes. Some of the other apps in the store require you to enter ingredients one at a time, specifying quantity and units separately, and then entering your recipe directions one step at a time. This makes the process for entering a single recipe way too cumbersome and takes up too much time.

We took the opposite approach and basically give you two big text fields for your ingredients and directions. Entry is completely freeform and you can basically put in whatever you want. This also makes it very easy to save recipes from the web (since they can be presented in all sorts of arbitrary formats).

Features include:

- Ability to type in your own custom recipes in a fairly easy manner.
- Ability to save recipes from the web.
- A grocery list that lets you add recipe ingredients as well as your own items.
- Fully customizable categories, search, favorites, and emailing recipes.
- Preventing the screen from turning off while cooking.

Here are a few promo codes to get you guys started:

LLK9KAWAYXLJ

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. The response has been fairly positive so far (in terms of ratings and reviews), although there is definitely room for us to improve.

I'm especially interested if anyone has thoughts on marketing and promotion. I've done the standard tasks of posting a press release and emailing a bunch of websites/blogs...but don't really know where to go from there. Has anyone had success with a Youtube teaser, or Facebook/Google ads, or buying ad banners on other sites?

Save money, be healthy, eat good food!

Every Monday I cook some red beans.

99 cents for 8 servings of dry red beans. One serving is over 33% RDA for protein, 15% Iron, 10% Vitamin C. Add rice or potato and you are full! 5 lbs of potatoes is 1 - 3 dollars. Ramen 99 cents for 4 - 8 packs.

1\. before you go to sleep for the night, put 1/2 cup of dried red beans in pot full of cold water to soak at least 8 hours (or bring to a boil, let set for 10 min, change water and follow recipe)

2\. two hours before you want to eat, start cooking beans: drain old water, add 3 cups fresh water and bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer for around an hour

3\. add 2 spoons wershishire sauce, 2 spoons catsup, 4 spoons oil, salt, pepper, bay leaves, oregano, basil , hot sauce. add optional chopped onion/garlic/bell pepper/jalapeo and simmer for 40 more minutes

4\. use a big spoon to smoosh 1/4 of beans against side of pan to thicken sauce and start boiling water to cook rice/potato/noodle. About 20 minutes.

Serve beans over rice/noodles.

OR -- just cut a potato into chunks and throw into pot to cook for 20 minutes

OR -- just throw in a ramen noodle packet in beans and cook last 10 min

OR -- microwave/bake a big potato and pour beans over this with some fresh chopped onion if avail.

Make a double size batch and save half of it and make burritos or whatever in a few days.

This is a hot topic near and dear to my heart.

I create a site 4 years ago that I've been writing on every since... there are probably near 2000 articles on it. Everything from fixing your MTU settings on your Q1000 modem to Java framework tips I find handy to years worth of game and movies reviews to hilarious cat pictures.

It's just anything and everything I've ever found interesting written in a slightly more professional manner than ""stream of thought"" with a small amount of attention paid to titles and internal links only when appropriate and valuable (I HATE how sites like Engadget inner-link every keyword for Google sake).

My understanding was always that ""If I wrote it, they will come"".

4 years later and that's not the case at all... I seem to be hitting a goddamn glass ceiling that I cannot figure out for the life of me why it exists or who is imposing it and I want to scream.

This topic on Reddit recently: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d7e24/my_job_was_to_game_digg_using_infographics_voting/

Got my ire up... then combined with typical junk search results I see on Google in any given day for a legit topic I'm searching for and I'm coming to the conclusion that you just can't win online unless you are an SEO-douchebag.

When was the last time you searched for something technical and found a CNET link and headed over only to notice it's a landing page that says ""We didn't review this BUT we reviewed..."" and has 97 links to other things on the site?

What the fuck.

Is this the only way to succeed now with this content diarrhea mill that is the web?

Say, hypothetically, I'm starting a new company that's extremely tech-heavy and I want to recruit the best engineers in the world. Fairness, recognition for effort, high hiring bar, the best equipment... all things that are important.

Why not go an extra step to be fair and make everyone's compensation public, including the founders? Why not open up the cap table to everyone, employed or potentially-employable? Then there's no question as to whether a candidate is getting a good deal.

What could possibly go wrong?

I graduated from Stanford in 2005. Since then I have had a great run in founding a company, getting funded, and we are a profitable start-up with 11 employees. Our revenues are in the 11-12MM range and I own a very large percent of the company. I didn't really want to have a co-founder but I did recruit a friend early on with whom I built the product, but he owns 8% (not a lot), and other employees own 1% and some later employees own 0.5%. The VC that funded us is great friends with my dad(which helped, also my dad initially bankrolled some of the setup costs), and we were profitable before starting so it all worked out in my favor, and however selfish it may sound, we ran with good salaries after getting funded, and I had started alone, so I didn't want to split equally. Also my friend didn't mind as he was/is drawing a good salary.

I am a run of the mill person (financially secure childhood, went to a good school, went to a good college, and have a good company that is probably going to grow around 10-20% over every year) meaning that I never really felt that I decided anything for myself, and I guess I am having a midlife crisis? but really I am just sick of my life and I have no idea what I am doing. Over the last year or two I managed to take some extended 2-3 week long breaks because before that there was a lot to do, so I guess I tried remedying it using breaks where I would not be connected to tech and just go hang out at the beaches of south America. It definitely gives me a clear head, but I am unable to think and decide clearly.

Over the last year and a half I have thought a lot about killing myself and have decided that I am not brave enough to carry on with something like that, but I really have no passion and some of what Tony Hseish (Zappos Guy) talks about in Delivering Happiness (book) really resonates with me. But I have more problems. Also on the outside I think I appear extremely happy and perfect but I guess I am more insecure and have started having self-worth issues.

I had a really great & happy childhood. Was bullied some in high school & was also a bully (went to a boarding school and really it was part of life, and wasn't something major or life altering). I experimented a bit with my bisexual-ism with consent of-course but it was merely part of growing up in an all boys environment. Anyway had a great college experience, blessed with 'good looks' genes, was in a popular fraternity, got laid a lot, and well experimented a lot with some random fantasies that I think I can somewhat attribute to an all boys boarding school upbringing. I don't drink much and have been smoking pot since 12 when I went to boarding school. I guess I turned out pretty well on the outside, but I think that I may be a rotten person. I know this and yet I am unable to do anything about it. I am generally not a good person I guess, I used to shoplift and still do on occasion, and some years ago I figured that I may have kleptomania, but I haven't really been diagnosed with it. Also I have always cheated on tests/exams if possible. I am usually nice to people / girls but I haven't had a stable relationship ever despite having a sexual relationships with many. I possibly see a lot of myself in the max tucker? but I don't sound like a jerk or brag about stuff (despite of what i am doing here).

Growing up I had no idea what I wanted to be, I just knew that I wanted to be extremely rich, and have all the shebang that comes along with it. Now I have a company that is generating a significant amount of revenue and healthy profits too, My parents were entrepreneurs and they are pretty wealthy but I wasn't aware of all that much at the point. I guess now I am not sure whether I want to be extremely wealthy (attainable in 7-9 years: 100MM, just an arbitrary figure I have, used to be much higher, but honestly that wasn't realistic) or just cash out now by trying to sell and settle for a lesser amount which would still be significant, plus hopefully inheritance later. This initial get rich scheme was fueled by all the ""Sydney Sheldon's"" that I read in high school and some other lewd literature, and at one point I seriously considered becoming a criminal. Growing up, 'The Godfather', 'Scarface', and of late 'American Gangster', 'Blow', 'Lord of War' have been my favorite movies. I have also read extensively about organized crime over the world.

Anyway I have these really sick fantasies which I also had as a child for some reason and I can't get the grip on how they started. Going to a small ""rules enforced"" all boys school and then being let loose on a college campus with good looking girls with whom I had little or no interaction growing up may have been a likely cause.<p>Anyways I guess I am just venting out to this community that I have been fortunate to learn about from about depression, and start-up stuff, and other random things. I shared some of my fantasies with a close friend like some months ago, and he said that he was disgusted and told me to see a therapist. Long story short, my first therapist was a female and we ended up having some adult fun, and then I went to see this other guy and he was like you should try and fulfill some of these and see how you feel after? so strike three, I went to this famous guy that wrote a book about hypnosis and has published papers about how that provides insight into childhood that may affect current behaviors and that also wasn't a really helpful session. The third guy did however say that I have a mild alternate personality. I don't want to go into much detail about what these feelings/fantasies are so as to not offend people, but just a fyi: they all involve adults and mostly female adults but are outright weird/ and to some extent sick and involve controlling? behavior and other dark stuff. I am sane enough to control these thoughts but there are times that my mind races and I enjoy having these thoughts and realizing in retrospect that they are not normal/acceptable/legal in some cases. Also, I fear that I might be slowly become the person that I am in my thoughts specially given the financial freedom that I am afforded by being lucky.

<p>Idk why I am putting up this rant, but it just feels to get it off my chest? and hopefully I can get some advice? Also I am mildly on a marijuana high so sorry if some of this sounds incomprehensible.

""Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for the work they do. One reason is that employees no longer trust companies to deliver deferred rewards: why work to accumulate deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out? The other is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees large amounts. This was particularly true in consulting, law, and finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies."" - http://paulgraham.com/credentials.html

As a college student who has been looking at entry-level law, consulting, and finance jobs for a while now, I really don't think this is true. These organizations pay young people ""a lot"", but it's ""a lot"" only by middle-class American standards. By internal standards, these organizations pay young people a pittance, in comparison to what they pay their senior people.

I would certainly agree that, during the 1980s, there began an increasing trend of job-hopping: working at a new company every few years, instead of working at the same company for forty years or more. This, notably, did not increase salaries; median salaries in the US, adjusted for inflation, have not risen at all since the 1970s (cite: http://www.eurotrib.com/files/3/051014_US_median_income.jpg). However, it probably did lead to the top performers getting paid more, and the bottom performers getting paid less. It also accelerated the breakup of large unions, whose bargaining power was diminished when companies found it increasingly easy to hire and fire at will.

This trend, even though it is real, does not really apply to consulting, law and finance, because these organizations are run very differently from the rest of the economy. For one thing, they operate as partnerships rather than public companies- the profits the company generates go directly to the high-level employees, rather than to outside shareholders. This insulates these companies from any threat of outside takeover, which was a major motivation for the destruction of the ""corporate ladder"" during the 1980s.

Secondly, they are all professional services companies, where the high-level people do sales and schmooze clients, and the low-level people do all the grunt work. A salesman can be measured directly by how many customers they bring in and how many deals they do. A low-level grunt, on the other hand, is much more difficult to measure (see, eg.: http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-in-investment-banking-by-slacking-off-and-pretending-to-work-hard/, which describes how to get ahead in investment banking without actually doing a lot of work).

As a result, the top people in these industries get paid spectacularly more than the newer, young people, frequently more than ten times as much. A new investment banker, just out of college, can reasonably expect to make six figures (http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-salaries-mcdonalds/). However, the top people, the Managing Directors, get paid seven up to eight figures. It's the same thing in consulting: you can make $70,000 straight out of school, but the partners will make $500,000 or $1,000,000. And in law (specifically corporate law), the starting salary may be $160,000, but the salary after five years is more like $400,000, and the partners take home millions.

And the higher salaries of these young people doesn't really reflect their value, in most cases; it just reflects the fact that they work an insane number of hours. If you're an investment banking analyst making $100,000 (including bonus), but you have to work 100 hours a week, that comes out to about $19 per hour, which is not much at all for someone with a 3.8 GPA from an Ivy League school (most of these companies only recruit at top schools).

So, why do these salaries seem like ""a lot""? Probably because most Americans have little contact with the upper class, and don't have a good idea of how large it is, or how much money the people in it make. When most people think of ""rich"", they think of people like their neighborhood doctor, who makes around $150,000 a year; in comparison, making $100,000 just out of school seems like a lot. However, if you look at the actual numbers (cite: http://www2.physics.umd.edu/~yakovenk/papers/EPL-69-304-2005.pdf), 99th percentile income in the US is $400,000. If we define the ""rich"" as the top 1% of the US population in terms of annual income, that means that there are 1.5 million rich people in the US. By this definition, there are more rich people in the US than Muslims, Hindus, or Buddhists (assuming that the children of the rich also count as ""rich""). The minimum income needed to be rich is $400,000, and the average income of a rich person is more like $700,000 or $900,000. So these law, finance and consulting companies certainly don't allow young people to join the ranks of the American upper class, even if they do get paid $100,000 a year.

I'm a fan of George R R Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire and among many things, I like his creativity with names. I was wondering if I can use a name from his series for my company. Perhaps I should ask this question directly from him, but he seems unapproachable.

So the question is, is it fine if I use a name from his books for my company without informing him in advance? Is there any legal problem with it? Is there any moral problem with it? If yes, how would you avoid them? Have you ever borrowed name of your company from a book?

Any hints/clues/ideas will be appreciated.

QuoraQuora connects you to everything you want to know about. LoginSign UpAirbnb:

Has anyone had the experience of your Host listings being turned off by AirBnB due to bringing to their attention problems with their platform and procedures? John Cohen, NYC HostYes

AirBnB recently hid all my listings. At the same time they cancelled over 19 bookings adding up to over $7000 dollars most likely more. Here is a copy of the email sent to those inconvenienced persons.

Dear xxxx, We were just informed by John Cohen that your accommodation starting on xxx, April xx, 2012 (reservation xxxxxxx) is no longer available. You should know that hosts are penalized for canceling reservations and removed from our site if they do so frequently.

I am no longer able to access my account to see my future payouts -- approximately $2000 dollars -- or when I will recieve $954.

At the suggestion of an experienced attorney I have backed all information that was in my account including changes that were occurring after AirBnB shut off my listings.

I cannot prove what the customer service supervisor said over the phone but I will quote ""We have discussed it among ourselves"", ""There are simply too many customer service requests from your account"", ""You can apply in two months to be re-instated.""

After careful review of the backups it appears to be 21 bookings not 17. As of this date several guests are living in my home. Booked through airBnB. I have no idea if I will be paid for their stay. Here is a short list of my Complaints that resulted in AirBnb hiding my listings.

1) Peer review process as implemented is being used by a few guests as a threat of a ""Bad review"" if I do not bend to demands for services not offered. Or if I attempt to enforce the House rules such as under age drinking or cleanig up after themselves.( Threse guests have no reviews of their own.)

2) Security Hole. Apparently airBnB does not maintain any information of the Guest of the guest.

3) CSR who answer the phones are given extraordinary power to rush to a judgement without giving the Host the benefit of the doubt.

4) Reservvation panel is a Mess if you are a busy Host. Dificult to make heads or tales from this. Even the CSR.

5) Bad reviews which are not opinion but statements of Fact. Say about the cleanliness of a Host. ""Place smells like Garbage"" Bathroom's are dirty"" by a guest who frequently broke house rules.

6) A clear and convincing connection between Guests who them selves have no reviews making a complaint or bad review on a Host who has asked them courteously to obey House rules.

7) Repeatedly blocking out up to 10 days or more on a room until an investigation is complete. Finding the Host acted properly

8) Many of my customer service calls were about parts of the WebSite not working or learning how to nagivate it properly. I have bad eye sight and need new glasses. EG recently a part of the listings page failed to show up where prominently it states Host has PETS. Two guests allergic to Cats appeared.

. Though my listing clearly states CATS. I had to have my House keeper Vacume 2,000 square feet. So that the guests could finish their bookings. My cats were trapped in my bedroom for two weeks.

9) Security deposit is not a security deposit. Never in my Life have I been compelled to negotiate with a petty thief

Their is a lot more. 24/7 is not 24/7 due to the lack of enouph Human Infrastructure to handle the Volume of calls. Resulting in knee jerk reaction's and bad decision making.

I cannot help get the feeling that AirBnb in my opinion would like low end Hosts to quietly fade and disappear in to the night.

This one will not.

The average star rating of my spare bed rooms was 4.5 Stars.

Skirting around the Franchise laws of the State of New York and the Federal Franchise Laws.

Skirting around the case law in New York State concerning Defamation and Slander.

And who knows what else. (SPIONS)

I am a fundamentaly good New Yorker. I am confident that my fellow New Yorkers will hear my cry for HELP.

I have been crippled financially by AirBnB's actions. Humiliated. Down but not out. I have nothing to loose. I am old sickly.

In my youth in basic training at the USMC. You learn the history of this Institution.

Lt. General Chesty Puller. ""You don't hurt 'em if you don't hit 'em.""

Below this you can read my reviews. It was AirBnB who cancelled the bookings and Defamed and Slandered this host. I removed most of the cancelations as the web page would have been to long.

The host canceled my reservation 11 days before arrival.

Emily The host canceled my reservation 46 days before arrival.

Alex The host canceled my reservation 16 days before arrival.

Katharina The host canceled my reservation 12 days before arrival.

Djamila The host canceled my reservation 32 days before arrival.

Amy The host canceled my reservation 22 days before arrival.

Wai The host canceled my reservation 5 days before arrival.

Dora The host canceled my reservation 15 days before arrival.

Melanie And Claas The host canceled my reservation 4 days before arrival.

Trevor The host canceled my reservation 18 days before arrival.

Liudmila The host canceled my reservation 90 days before arrival.

Jana Fabienne The host canceled my reservation 139 days before arrival.

Alisia The host canceled my reservation 3 days before arrival.

Francesca The host canceled my reservation 14 days before arrival.

Alonso I stayed here because I didn't want to spend a fortune in a hotel, so I booked at John's place. My room was pretty cozy, clean and had air conditioner (which was really helpful on those cold nights). The living room/kitchen/dinning room was ok, and I liked the fact that there were other guests living there as well and I met a lot of interesting people. I would recommend your stay here if you want to save money, socialize with other cultures and know how to clean after yourself (important part). It is up to you if you want a clean room. The walls are really thin and sometimes you can hear everything from the room next to yours, but overall, it is good place for low price.

Lauren Don't expect luxury & do not come here if you're allergic to cats as John has 2 (very cute) or if you don't know how to clean up after yourself (you will get told!). This place is secure and very affordable for those on a budget, the beds/toilets/towels are clean and John offers coffee every morning. All in all, if you can forego any frills and live in a hostel environment, this is a good deal. If not, try the Waldorf Astoria.

Viola The place is just two blocks from the subway stop and it really takes 10 minutes to get to Manhattan so is ideal if you don't want to waste your day travelling. I have found quite a friendly bunch of people living in John's loft and John himself is a very helpful person. I would suggest to guests who have never seen NYC to ask him tips on what's worth seeing in the City. The constant presence of coffee in the place was, also, very much appreciate!!! My overall experience was pretty positive and I would recommend it.

Peter John was a very nice host. The room is great value for money. Expect no luxury, ""this isn't the Waldorf-Astoria"", as John would say. But it's a room, more or less private, allthough you can hear everything that's going on in the livingroom. But if you're in NYC for a few days, it's a great, cheap spot. The room I rented had some temperture-issues, the heater was a bit hard to control, and made some loud noises sometimes, but John told me this in advance. He was helpful all the way.

Kyle It was a nice private room! John was very helpful in getting me acclimated to New York City, and he even made me a nice BLT sandwich right when I arrived!

David Relacin calidad precio muy buena. Barrio""aburrido"" pero el piso est muy bien conectado (parada de metro cerca). Spermercado cerca. Lo recomiendo positivamente para pasar ah unas vacaciones. John personalmente me trat muy bien. Incluso cuando tuve problemas con la habitacin S-9, la cual no recomiendo en invierno porque estn dentro las mquinas de la calefaccin central (mucho ruido y calor), fue fcil llegar a un acuerdo para que me diera otra habitacin que tena libre. No s que hubiese pasado si no hubiera habido alguna habitacin libre. En definitiva es un buen sitio para pasar tus vacaciones en NY a muy buen precio.

Johannes Best bang for the buck. Don't expect luxury and don't be too picky, but there's everything you need and it's a private room at a great rate. Quite uncomplicated, I could do some short notice extension as I decided to stay one night longer, and then even one more.

Iveta I've recently stayed at the shared room for 5 nights. It was a great experience, I can recommend this rental. John is a great host, he is going out of his way to accommodate everybody's requests. He is friendly and he is a great cook too! I am planning to be back in New York at the end of April and I will stay at this place again. I think that says a lot! it is a great place for a great price.

New Johns place is as described, a huge and quiet loft that he built. Not luxury but its a good way to save money if youre going to expend the whole day exploring the city. Its close to the subway station wiht direct line to manhattan (A and C line). John makes coffee every morning for the guests and he cleans the bathrooms every morning as well.

Veronika Great way to save money on a trip to NYC. Bring your own blankets because it gets very cold at night and there are none for you to use. The area is safe enough but it gets very deserted at night. Coffee in the mornings was great. Don't expect any privacy or luxury staying here but it is a cheap way to see NYC. FYI, smoking is allowed indoors and there are two cats. Average age of other guests is 22-25.

Camille Another host nearby could not host me. He sent me to John's place. As a young 18 year old french woman traveling alone I am careful. The accommodations were incredible for just $10. per day. $11. with the AirBnB fee. It is a medium size room. Very bright. Sun drenched as the host John says. Though it has 4 twin beds on 2 wooden bunks and one twin it is not cluster phobic. It is meant as a budget shared room to sleep in. The vanity was nice. Storage that I locked with a padlock. The rest of the Loft is large. Balcony's, gigantic rear deck and a giant private roof with nice views including Manhattan. I had the room all by myself. But met several interesting Europeans from Germany and Italy renting the private rooms. The common area is large. Nice kitchen dining area. Unusual. The large refrigerator is in the same room as the shower. John is an artist. The shower room is large. The host was very helpful. He showed me how to use the MTA Trip planner to efficiently travel to my activities in Manhattan. John has to be the best Host on AirBnB and possibly all of NYC ! Twice he made me a delicious meal ! 3-4 Minute walk to Subway. A metro. 20 minutes 34 street Manhattan off peak ! I am glad the other host cancelled. $10. nightly. safe, clean convenient, food. #1 host and place to stay in NYC. Oh it is $10. for thirty day stay. The price is more expensive for 3 days or a week but still cheapest in NYC ! Thank you John. 5 stars. He deserves 10 stars !

Guido John is a very good host... the loft is in a good neighborhood just short walk from a supermarket and utica subway station... and just 20 minutes far from Manhattan with public transprtation!!! Sure i would be back there next time i'm going to NYC! and if you are a good traveler who really wants to discover the real life of the place you are visiting sure you'll enjoy this place. Very safe, good wi fi connection, clean and easy! see you next time John!

Patrick This accomodation is by far the best value for a short-stay room in New York that I have seen. The cost for my own room per night actually worked out even cheaper than a hostel where a person would share a full dormitory of 6-8 people. This place was great value - and I had my own room. The host was very helpful. My first experience of his helpfulness was when I noticed that my computer cable had broken. When I asked him if he knew where I could get a replacement in the city, he actually went out of his way to fix the cable for me! He saved me a number of bucks doing this, and also saved me the time it would have taken to locate the replacement. Big thanks to him for that. And that was just the first day. The host has coffee on the stove every morning. It is also likely he will cook something for you a few times during your stay. It could be a roast, or it could be a big breakfast sandwich that will keep you going for a number of hours. The crowd that I came across in the place was mostly young and vibrant and interesting. It is a good place for you to meet up with like-minded adventurers in the city of New York. The host has a large amount of very practical local knowledge. He has a large willingness to share very useful knowledge with you. This was invaluable for me because, as a soon-to-be qualified attorney, I was in town to find out the possibilities of locating a long-term apartment lease and a job in the city. The host went out of his way to share his valuable knowledge with me about these things. The host is worth listening to carefully. The quality of the place was very satisfactory. If you are a complainer or nit-picker, or have impossibly high standards, don't waste anybody's time and get a 150 buck a night hotel instead. However, if you want something with great value and have realistic expectations of what great value is, then you will really benefit from staying in a place like this. Even though I give a 4-star rating (which is very good), I actually give the extra 5th star in the rating when I factor in the price and all the extras. Again, have realistic expectations for a place in this price range, and appreciate good value when you see it, despite being a little rough around the edges. Furthermore, as time goes on, the host continually makes improvements to the place and has a genuine commitment to creating accomodation that adds value to the people who stay there. I expect the place will only become better and better in the future.

Matthew 5 stars! I had a great stay with John in his loft apartment. His description of the living space is very accurate. My room was clean and spacious, the loft was quiet through the night (had no disruptions from flatmates in other rooms), the bathrooms were clean and John even cooked 2 meals for me during my stay (quite the chef I might add)! For the price range and location, this listing can't be beat!

Stephanie John is a welcoming friendly host. Staying at his place in a private room beats staying at a hostel sharing with 3-11 other unknowns. Also he makes sure he only rents to non-sketchy people, which can only be a good thing. It's close to Manhattan, the neighbourhood doesn't look safe but is actually really ok and I doubt you can get a better deal than this. Peace out!

J. B. John is a gracious and welcoming host. The property is as described, and the bed is very comfortable. The place (as stated) is rough-hewn, but clean, quiet., and comfortable. The A train express is just two blocks away, so this is very convenient to Manhattan.

Stephanie We transferred to another room because it was cheaper. But it's not that small - still a good size AND it's private after all. John offered us some dinner one day which was pretty darn good. He does keep things clean around here (but a lot of it depends on other guests here too) so he's a good host.

Bettina John's Place is very close to the train station and in a safe area. I never felt insecure during the whole stay. The rooms are in a loft and have all the advantages of a loft: the common room, that everybody can use, is big and there are several very big patios which is great for summer. You are welcome to use the big kitchen and because John is a great cook, you should accept his weekly invitation for a meal. John also knows a lot about New York and has a lot of material and information to share. He answered my E-mails amazingly fast and helped us a lot to find the way from the airport to his place. On the other side, you should be aware, that the walls in the loft are very thin and you can hear everything. During the night it sometimes became very cold in the rooms, because the rooms are very high and the heat accumulated under the ceiling. There is just one shared shower for all. Altogether it's a nice place to stay. But if you want to stay in New York for several weeks, you should first test this place for some days and then decide if this is the right place for you. Best wishes, Bettina

Isabella The place is really nice and clean and super close to the subway. My room had a beautiful view and a comfy bed. John can be a little intense, on the first night he was quite annoyed with me for catching a cab as he said cab drivers were ""crooks"" but after that he was very helpful and pleasant. Even gave me some delicious roast he made and let me hang out past check out time. All in all it was a good experience.

Stephanie Really nice spacious room which I shared with my cousin and we had ample space for all our stuff. The location is pretty near to the station, about five minutes walk away. John is a really helpful host and made sure we had a place to stay on New Year's night when he found out that we didn't have anywhere to go for that night. And honestly I don't think you'll find a better deal for the price you pay, especially if you're travelling alone in NYC :)

Yoojin I couldn't agree more with Nacio's exact review. Close distance from subway station and warm rooms are good. However, if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, I don't recommend this place. He smokes inside the house and rooms for guests have a big glassless hole facing kitchen where he usually smoke. Considering the cheap price of room, you may bear some shortcomings.. but I don't think it's comfortable to live for a long time in this house.

Ling Sum Great stay, great location! John is a perfect host. The room is big enough. The neighborhood is safe!

Adam Hey travelers! I stayed at john's space in crown heights, Brooklyn for 10 days & would recommend it to any of you out there on a budget who don't need many frills. It feels like a cross between a hostel & a friend's place - there were long term & short term guests here - everyone was respectful & quiet. Excellent value for money & steps away from 24 hour transit anywhere in NYC. The shower needs improvement but it's a great place to hang yer hat. Would/will stay here again. Thanks John, Merry holiday everyone!!! Adam

Cristina I wouldn't choose Jonn's in matter of the size of the room. But it was comfortable and the practical facilities all right. Besides the room there is a ' shared space' where it is possible to spend time/ do activities if the space of the room isnt 'satisfying' which works fine. The bed was fine. Transport to Manhattan is easy.

Carmen If you are considering a hostel, this would be a much better choice. The rooms are private; there is a fridge, basic cooking facilities and John makes coffee every morning. John gives fair warning about the neighborhood and I certainly wouldn't walk around late at night, but it is very near the train, the grocery store and laundromat are walking distance and the neighborhood folk are generally friendly. It is definitely worth the price.

Giorgio Nice room, close to subway station and to everything, few minutes to Manhattan. Mattresses, sheetes and pillows where new when we arrived. John is funny and very helpful, he gave us a lot of advices.

Nirmal Good place overall. Pros: own room with lock and key, on A express line, cheap Cons: My clothes smelled like smoke, cats kept me up 3 nights, the fridge is in the bathroom for some reason. the area is a little ghetto but overall safe since very close to the main road. John and everyone in the house is friendly and keep the place clean, though i bought my own cleaning wipes and cleaned the toilets few times. I expected that since the place has 9 rooms and just 2 toilets and 1 bathroom. john was very gracious and offered dinner on more than 2 occasions. for $29 a night it was a bargain.

Isabell It's a good place to stay for a few weeks if you need an affordable homebase while you're exploring the city The subway is just a short walk away, it takes about 20 minutes to get to the west side of downtown Manhattan, which for New York is very okay. John is a helpful host, often offering his guests food and good advice or tips on where to go and how to get there. There is a large common area with a kitchen that holds everything you need; the bathrooms and shower are also shared by all. Rooms have loft beds, drawers, chairs, tables, lamps - in short, everything you need. If anything's missing, just ask; John is quite good at providing anything extra (for example the extension cord and socket adapter I needed to get comfortable in bed with my laptop). If you have any more questions, just ask, I'll be happy to help you out.

Adam I stayed at Johns place for just over a week. The location of the place is great, only a short walk to the train station and ~10 min to lower Manhattan. There was also on the street parking easily available. John was a great host, provided me information on how to get around and also recommended some places to check out. Its great value for money, would stay here again if I'm in NYC. Room was sun drenched and clean. He offered coffee every morning. The complimentary BLT he made for me was delicious. If anyone has any questions just send me an email.

Elena Yo y mi amigo nos hospedamos en una habitacin preciosa baada por el sol. La casa situada en un barrio seguro y autentico newyorkino estaba a pocos minutos del metro. John es muy simptico y habla espaol nos ayudo mucho ofreciendo su ayuda para organizar nuestro viaje mejor. Gracias John!

Rhona Very helpful when we had a last minute emergency, my daughter was in New York without internet and I was in Scotland and I had to find her somewhere quickly. He replied immediately and made up the room for her. She says it was great to have a private room and room to open a case and hang up clothes. Easy to come and go as you get your own key and it's close to everything you need especially the subway. She says she felt safe in the house and the neighbourhood, even as a solo female. Complimentary coffee was also nice as was the BLT he made one day. CommentLoading... Repost 1:16 on Tue Mar 27 2012 Cannot add comment if you are logged out.

After over 10 years of becoming gradually removed from development (as a director of a 50+ person company), I've taken a head-first dive back into it while I travel around the world and freelance.

What tools/software do you currently use for web development, on a Mac platform? I'm not attached to anything, and want to use whatever will make me most efficient (even at an initial cost). Here's my current set-up (mostly PHP development). I should also note that, because of intermittent wi-fi access while traveling, I usually prefer native desktop apps to web apps.

* MacBook (aluminium) with a small Verbatim back-up drive and hard case (I'm traveling the world at the moment), plus Time Machine

* DropBox for real-time backing up my ~/Sites/ and other important directories

* MAMP Pro for easy administration of the LAMP stack

* Quicksilver (I find it fractions-of-a-second faster than Spotlight, which makes a difference)

* InstantShot and Paparazzi! for website screenshots (for pitches, etc)

* SimpleTask (for To-Do list)

* Mail.app (managing multiple accounts, including Gmail)

* TextWrangler (as my main text editor / IDE - I'm especially not tied to this)

* Filezilla (SFTP/FTP/etc)

* Terminal (love the multi-tabs; always have a tab open with a grep -R ready for searching; find it much faster than using an in-IDE search across files)

* Chrome (with the Web Developer extension) as my main browser; also Firefox, Safari

* Parallels with Windows 7 (to run Internet 8/7 natively with debugging tools; prefer it to WineBottler, etc)

* Skype (for cheap/free conversations and screen-sharing with clients)

* OmniGraffle Pro (UX, Wireframing, sketching)

* Fireworks (Graphics work)

* Flux (for making late-night work semi-comfortable)

* Silverback (usability testing)

Anything I should switch-out or add? I'm looking for efficiency and speed over detailed configuration, open source / licensing or price. Thanks in advance, HN'ers!

FW14-e110-7486-02	What would you do if you were me?	"11 points

I feel as if I'm stuck in a no-win situation in my career, and I'm wondering HN readers, what would you do if you were me?

Here's my story: I'm in my late 40s and have been involved in information technology professionally for my entire adult life (and even did board-level repair of early personal computers when I was in high-school). For the past 20+ years I've been involved in IT audit and information security as an auditor and consultant, and as an information security manager. I'm technical enough that I'm currently a security-architect / sales-engineer for a large telecommunications vendor. I've tried two startups in the past (mobile robotics and security consulting). Neither were overly successful, but I learned a lot. I currently live in the upper midwest, am married (for 20+ years), have three children (ages 12-18), and make a decent living. Sounds great, right? I should be happy.

Here's the problem: I'm not making anything! I'm not creating! I strongly feel I'm a ""Maker"", a ""Developer"", but I may have realized this too late.

During the evening, I program for fun (mostly Ruby on Rails, these days, but Lisp, Python, C, and micro-controller assembly in the past). I'm not the greatest programmer, mostly because I can only do it a few hours each week (let's say ~10 hours per week), but I can get by. And, I really enjoy it. So, I'd like to do more programming. And, I'd like to do another startup. I have SaaS B2B application in mind. But, it seems at my age it is going to be impossible to shift from my current career to a programming career or to do another startup because the lifestyle change (read ""drop-in-income, at least for a while"") will be intolerable, especially for my family. Does that mean I'm done? Game over? At this point, am I doomed to sitting on the side-lines and only watching or being a cheerleader to other developers and startups? What have other professionals who have been in my situation (""golden handcuffs"") done to get around this? I've had a successful career (especially for someone who didn't complete college), but with three teenagers, it's not like I have a stash of cash available to make the transition.
