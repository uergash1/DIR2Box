FW14-e109-7293-10	Scarpetta Spaghetti With Tomato Sauce	"One of the secrets to this popular version of a ubiquitous dish is the infused oil that flavors the tomato sauce. Scott Conant, chef-owner of Scarpetta in New York, says the last thing that goes into a dish is the first thing you'll taste, so he makes an oil infused with garlic, basil and crushed red pepper flakes and adds that to his cooked tomato sauce. (The other secret would be butter.) Conant acknowledges that ""spaghetti"" is a misnomer for this pasta. It's linguine, or actually tonnarelli, which is easier to produce at home than spaghetti because it doesn't require a pasta extruder. Canned San Marzano tomatoes may be used to replace some or all of the fresh tomatoes in the sauce. In Internet videos of this recipe, Conant suggests that a high-quality dried pasta could replace the homemade version. You'll need a pasta-rolling machine. Type 00 flour is a fine-milled flour available at specialty stores and some supermarkets. We found it at A. Litteri, Seasonal Pantry and Whole Foods Market Foggy Bottom in the District. All-purpose flour may be substituted."
