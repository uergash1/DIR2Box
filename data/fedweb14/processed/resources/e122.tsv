Grape Seed Extract and oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) clearly possess remarkable antioxidant properties. Their effects on reducing free radical damage and oxidative stress suggest that they may be particularly effective in reducing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and a number of the chronic diseases associated with ageing. It is 20 times more potent than Vitamin C and 50 times stronger than Vitamin E. 

It is an antiallergenic or antihistamine, anti-inflammatory, and an antioxidant. It strengthens blood vessels, improves skin and aids in circulation. Researchers have discovered that Grape Seed Extract can help defeat the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which stops the hair follicle growth cycle. Grape Seed Extract can help stimulate healthy hair growth.

FW14-e122-7215-09	"#saffron 

Initial research suggests that carotenoids present in saffron are anticarcinogenic (cancer-suppressing),anti-mutagenic (mutation-preventing), and immunomodulatory. Dimethylcrocetin, the compound thought responsible for these effects, counters a wide range of murine (rodent) tumours and human leukaemia cell lines. Saffron extract also delays ascites tumour growth, delays papilloma carcinogenesis, inhibits squamous cell carcinoma, and decreases soft tissue sarcoma incidence in treated mice. Researchers theorise that, based on the results of thymidine-uptake studies, such anticancer activity is best attributed to dimethylcrocetin's disruption of the DNA-binding ability of a class of enzymes known as type II topoisomerases. As topoisomerases play a key role in managing DNA topology, the malignant cells are less successful in synthesizing or replicating their own DNA. 
Saffron's pharmacological effects on malignant tumours have been documented in several studies: it extends the lives of mice that are intraperitoneally impregnated with transplanted sarcomas, namely, samples of S-180, Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA), and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) tumours. Researchers followed this by orally administering 200 mg (0.0071 oz) of saffron extract for each kg of mouse body weight. As a result the life spans of the tumour-bearing mice were respectively altered to 111.0%, 83.5%, and 112.5% of the baseline or reference span. Researchers also discovered that saffron extract exhibits cytotoxicity in relation to DLA, EAC, P38B, and S-180 tumour cell lines cultured in vitro. 
Besides wound-healing and anticancer properties, saffron is also an antioxidant. This means that, as an ""anti-aging"" agent, it neutralises free radicals. Methanol extractions of saffron neutralise at high rates the DPPH (IUPAC nomenclature: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radicals. This occurred via vigorous proton donation to DPPH by two of saffron's active agents, safranal and crocin. At concentrations of 500 and 1000 ppm, crocin studies showed neutralisation of 50% and 65% of radicals, respectively. Safranal displayed a lesser rate of radical neutralisation than crocin. Such findings give saffron extracts promise as an ingredient for use as an antioxidant in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and as a food supplement.Antidepressant effects have been demonstrated.﻿

FW14-e122-7250-08	"What Causes Dry Eyes? 
In addition to an imbalance in the tear-flow system of the eye, dry eyes can be caused by situations that dry out the tear film. This can be due to dry air from air conditioning, heat, or other environmental conditions. Other conditions that may cause dry eyes are: 
-The natural aging process, especially menopause. 
-Side effects of certain drugs such as antihistamines and birth control pills. 
-Diseases that affect the ability to make tears, such as Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and collagen vascular diseases. 
-Structural problems with the eye lids that don't allow them to close properly.

FW14-e122-7250-07	"Hey, my dear friend. That is why we always stick to ride a bicycle. 

See the following article 

30 reasons to take up cycling 

1\. You’ll get there faster 

Commute by bike in the UK’s major cities and you’ll get there in half the time of cars, research by Citroen shows. In fact, if you drive for an hour in Cardiff’s rush hour, you’ll spend over 30 minutes going absolutely nowhere and average just 7mph, compared to averaging around 12-15mph while cycling. 

2\. Sleep more deeply 

An early morning ride might knacker you out in the short term, but it’ll help you catch some quality shut-eye when you get back to your pillow. Stanford University School of Medicine researchers asked sedentary insomnia sufferers to cycle for 20-30 minutes every other day. The result? The time required for the insomniacs to fall asleep was reduced by half, and sleep time increased by almost an hour. 

“Exercising outside exposes you to daylight,” explains Professor Jim Horne from Loughborough University’s Sleep Research Centre. “This helps get your circadian rhythm back in sync, and also rids your body of cortisol, the stress hormone that can prevent deep, regenerative sleep.” 

3\. Look younger 

Scientists at Stanford University have found that cycling regularly can protect your skin against the harmful effects of UV radiation and reduce the signs of ageing. Harley Street dermatologist Dr Christopher Rowland Payne explains: “Increased circulation through exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to skin cells more effectively, while ﬂushing harmful toxins out. Exercise also creates an ideal environment within the body to optimise collagen production, helping reduce the appearance of wrinkles and speed up the healing process.” Don’t forget to slap on the factor 30 before you head out, though. 

4\. Boost your bowels 

According to experts from Bristol University, the beneﬁts of cycling extend deep into your core. “Physical activity helps decrease the time it takes food to move through the large intestine, limiting the amount of water absorbed back into your body and leaving you with softer stools, which are easier to pass,” explains Harley Street gastroenterologist Dr Ana Raimundo. 

In addition, aerobic exercise accelerates your breathing and heart rate, which helps to stimulate the contraction of intestinal muscles. “As well as preventing you from feeling bloated, this helps protect you against bowel cancer,” Dr Raimundo says. 

5\. Increase your brain power 

Need your grey matter to sparkle? Then get pedalling. Researchers from Illinois University found that a ﬁve percent improvement in cardio-respiratory ﬁtness from cycling led to an improvement of up to 15 percent in mental tests. That’s because cycling helps build new brain cells in the hippocampus – the region responsible for memory, which deteriorates from the age of 30. 

“It boosts blood ﬂow and oxygen to the brain, which ﬁres and regenerates receptors, explaining how exercise helps ward off Alzheimer’s,” says the study’s author, Professor Arthur Kramer. 

6\. Beat illness 

Forget apples, riding’s the way to keep the doctor at bay. “Moderate exercise makes immune cells more active, so they’re ready to ﬁght off infection,” says Cath Collins, chief dietician at St George’s Hospital in London. 

In fact, according to research from the University of North Carolina, people who cycle for 30 minutes, ﬁve days a week take about half as many sick days as couch potatoes. 

7\. Live longer 

King’s College London compared over 2,400 identical twins and found those who did the equivalent of just three 45-minute rides a week were nine years ‘biologically younger’ even after discounting other inﬂuences, such as body mass index (BMI) and smoking. 

“Those who exercise regularly are at signiﬁcantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease, type two diabetes, all types of cancer, high blood pressure and obesity,” says Dr Lynn Cherkas, who conducted the research. “The body becomes much more efﬁcient at defending itself and regenerating new cells.” 

8\. Save the planet 

Twenty bicycles can be parked in the same space as one car. It takes around ﬁve percent of the materials and energy used to make a car to build a bike, and a bike produces zero pollution. 

Bikes are efﬁcient, too – you travel around three times as fast as walking for the same amount of energy and, taking into account the ‘fuel’ you put in your ‘engine’, you do the equivalent of 2,924 miles to the gallon. You have your weight ratio to thank: you’re about six times heavier than your bike, but a car is 20 times heavier than you. 

9\. Improve your sex life 

Being more physically active improves your vascular health, which has the knock-on effect of boosting your sex drive, according to health experts in the US. One study from Cornell University also concluded that male athletes have the sexual prowess of men two to ﬁve years younger, with physically ﬁt females delaying the menopause by a similar amount of time. 

Meanwhile, research carried out at Harvard University found that men aged over 50 who cycle for at least three hours a week have a 30 percent lower risk of impotence than those who do little exercise. 

10\. It’s good breeding 

A ‘bun in the oven’ could beneﬁt from your riding as much as you. According to research from Michigan University in the US, mums-to-be who regularly exercise during pregnancy have an easier, less complicated labour, recover faster and enjoy better overall mood throughout the nine months. Your pride and joy also has a 50 percent lower chance of becoming obese and enjoys better in-utero neurodevelopment. 

“There’s no doubt that moderate exercise such as cycling during pregnancy helps condition the mother and protect the foetus,” says Patrick O’Brien, a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. 

11\. Heal your heart 

Studies from Purdue University in the US have shown that regular cycling can cut your risk of heart disease by 50 percent. And according to the British Heart Foundation, around 10,000 fatal heart attacks could be avoided each year if people kept themselves ﬁtter. Cycling just 20 miles a week reduces your risk of heart disease to less than half that of those who take no exercise, it says. 

12\. Your boss will love you 

No, we don’t mean your Lycra-clad buttocks will entice your superiors into a passionate ofﬁce romance, but they’ll appreciate what cycling does for your usefulness to the company. A study of 200 people carried out by the University of Bristol found that employees who exercised before work or at lunchtime improved their time and workload management, and it boosted their motivation and their ability to deal with stress. 

The study also reported that workers who exercised felt their interpersonal performance was better, they took fewer breaks and found it easier to ﬁnish work on time. Sadly, the study didn’t ﬁnd a direct link between cycling and getting a promotion. 

13\. Cycle away from the big C 

There’s plenty of evidence that any exercise is useful in warding off cancer, but some studies have shown that cycling is speciﬁcally good for keeping your cells in working order. One long-term study carried out by Finnish researchers found that men who exercised at a moderate level for at least 30 minutes a day were half as likely to develop cancer as those who didn’t. And one of the moderate forms of exercise they cited? Cycling to work. Other studies have found that women who cycle frequently reduce their risk of breast cancer by 34 percent. 

14\. Lose weight in the saddle 

Loads of people who want to shift some heft think that heading out for a jog is the best way to start slimming down. But while running does burn a ton of fat, it’s not kind to you if you’re a little larger than you’d like to be. Think about it – two to three times your body weight goes crashing through your body when your foot strikes the ground. If you weigh 16 stone, that’s a lot of force! Instead, start out on a bike – most of your weight is taken by the saddle, so your skeleton doesn’t take a battering. Running can wait… 

15\. You’ll make more money 

If you’re cycling to lose weight then you could be in line for a cash windfall… Well, sort of. Researcher Jay Zagorsky, from Ohio State University, analysed data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth – which saw 7,300 people regularly interviewed between 1985 and 2000 – to see how their obesity and wealth changed over that period. Zagorsky concluded that a one unit increase in body mass index (BMI) score corresponded to an £800 or eight percent reduction in wealth. So, shed a few BMI points on the bike and start earning. 

16\. Avoid pollution 

You’d think a city cyclist would suck up much more pollution than the drivers and passengers in the vehicles chucking out the noxious gases. Not so, according to a study carried out by Imperial College London. Researchers found that passengers in buses, taxis and cars inhaled substantially more pollution than cyclists and pedestrians. 

On average, taxi passengers were exposed to more than 100,000 ultraﬁne particles – which can settle in the lungs and damage cells – per cubic centimetre. Bus passengers sucked up just under 100,000 and people in cars inhaled about 40,000. Cyclists, meanwhile, were exposed to just 8,000 ultraﬁne particles per cubic centimetre. It’s thought that cyclists breathe in fewer fumes because we ride at the edge of the road and, unlike drivers, aren’t directly in the line of exhaust smoke. 

17\. Enjoy healthy family time 

Cycling is an activity the whole family can do together. The smallest tyke can clamber into a bike seat or tow-along buggy, and because it’s kind on your joints, there’s nothing to stop grandparents joining in too. 

Moreover, your riding habit could be sowing the seeds for the next Bradley Wiggins. Studies have found that, unsurprisingly, kids are inﬂuenced by their parents’ exercise choices. Put simply, if your kids see you riding regularly, they think it’s normal and will want to follow your example. Don’t be surprised, though, if they become embarrassed by your tendency to mismatch ﬂuorescent Lycra when they become teenagers. 

18\. It means guilt-free snacks 

Upping your salt intake is seldom your doctor’s advice, but in the few days leading up to a big ride or sportive, that’s exactly what you should do. This gives you the perfect excuse to munch on crisps and other salty foods you might normally avoid. The sodium in them helps protect your body against hyponatraemia, a condition caused by drinking too much water without enough sodium that can lead to disorientation, illness and worse. 

19\. Get better at any sport 

Whether you want to keep in prime shape or just improve your weekly tennis game, a stint in the saddle is the way to begin. A recent medical study from Norway carried the title Aerobic Endurance Training Improves Soccer Performance, which makes it pretty clear that the knock-on beneﬁts to other sports and activities are immense. 

20\. Make creative breakthroughs 

Writers, musicians, artists, top executives and all kinds of other professionals use exercise to solve mental blocks and make decisions – including Jeremy Paxman, Sir Alan Sugar and Spandau Ballet. A study found that just 25 minutes of aerobic exercise boosts at least one measure of creative thinking. Credit goes to the ﬂow of oxygen to your grey matter when it matters most, sparking your neurons and giving you breathing space away from the muddle and pressures of ‘real life’. 

21\. You’re helping others 

Many cyclists turn their health, ﬁtness and determination into fundraising efforts for the less fortunate. The London to Brighton bike ride has raised over £40 million for the British Heart Foundation since the two became involved in 1980, with countless other rides contributing to the coffers of worthy causes. 

22\. You can get fit without trying too hard 

Regular, everyday cycling has huge beneﬁts that can justify you binning your wallet-crippling gym membership. According to the National Forum for Coronary Heart Disease Foundation in the US, regular cyclists enjoy a ﬁtness level equal to that of a person who’s 10 years younger. 

23\. Boost your bellows 

No prizes for guessing that the lungs work considerably harder than usual when you ride. An adult cycling generally uses 10 times the oxygen they’d need to sit in front of the TV for the same period. Even better, regular cycling will help strengthen your cardiovascular system over time, enabling your heart and lungs to work more efﬁciently and getting more oxygen where it’s needed, quicker. This means you can do more exercise for less effort. How good does that sound? 

24\. Burn more fat 

Sports physiologists have found that the body’s metabolic rate – the efﬁciency with which it burns calories and fat – is not only raised during a ride, but for several hours afterwards. “Even after cycling for 30 minutes, you could be burning a higher amount of total calories for a few hours after you stop,” says sports physiologist Mark Simpson of Loughborough University. 

And as you get ﬁtter, the beneﬁts are more profound. One recent study showed that cyclists who incorporated fast intervals into their ride burned three-and-a-half times more body fat than those who cycled constantly but at a slower pace. 

25\. You’re developing a positive addiction 

Replace a harmful dependency – such as cigarettes, alcohol or eating too much chocolate – with a positive one, says William Glasser, author of Positive Addiction. The result? You’re a happier, healthier person getting the kind of ﬁx that boosts the good things in life. 

26\. Get (a legal) high 

Once a thing of myth, the infamous ‘runner’s high’ has been proven beyond doubt by German scientists. Yet despite the name, this high is applicable to all endurance athletes. University of Bonn neurologists visualised endorphins in the brains of 10 volunteers before and after a two-hour cardio session using a technique called positive emission tomography (PET). Comparing the pre- and post-run scans, they found evidence of more opiate binding of the happy hormone in the frontal and limbic regions of the brain – areas known to be involved in emotional processing and dealing with stress. 

“There’s a direct link between feelings of wellbeing and exercise, and for the ﬁrst time this study proves the physiological mechanism behind that,” explains study co-ordinator Professor Henning Boecker. 

27\. Make friends and stay healthy 

The social side of riding could be doing you as much good as the actual exercise. University of California researchers found socialising releases the hormone oxytocin, which buffers the ‘ﬁght or ﬂight’ response. 

Another nine-year study from Harvard Medical School found those with the most friends cut the risk of an early death by more than 60 percent, reducing blood pressure and strengthening their immune system. The results were so signiﬁcant that the researchers concluded not having close friends or conﬁdants is as detrimental to your health as smoking or carrying extra weight. Add in the ﬁtness element of cycling too and you’re onto a winner. 

28\. Be happy 

Even if you’re miserable when you saddle up, cranking through the miles will lift your spirits. “Any mild-to-moderate exercise releases natural feel-good endorphins that help counter stress and make you happy,” explains Andrew McCulloch, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation. That’s probably why four times more GPs prescribe exercise therapy as their most common treatment for depression compared to three years ago. “Just three 30-minute sessions a week can be enough to give people the lift they need,” says McCulloch. 

Sounds counter-intuitive but if you feel too tired for a ride, the best thing you can do is go for ride. Physical activity for even a few minutes is a surprisingly effective wake-up call. A review of 12 studies on the link between exercise and fatigue carried out between 1945 and 2005 found that exercise directly lowers fatigue levels. 

30\. Spend quality time with your partner 

It doesn’t matter if your paces aren’t perfectly matched – just slow down and enjoy each other’s company. Many couples make one or two riding ‘dates’ every week. And it makes sense: exercise helps release feel-good hormones, so after a ride you’ll have a warm feeling towards each other even if he leaves the toilet seat up and her hair is blocking the plughole again.﻿

FW14-e122-7250-06	"Rosacea Home Care Remedy 

#Rosacea is a skin disorder marked by redness. Bumps, pimples and papules sometimes develop on the affected area. It principally occurs on the face (forehead, nose and cheeks). In extreme case, the chin, scalp, upper back, chest and ears may be affected. 

When rosacea first develops, it may appear then disappear. It may return after a few days or weeks. When it disappears on its own i.e. without medication, the skin does not return to its original colour. 

The surface of skin of the affected area may remain rosy and sometimes a spidery network of reddish lines may be visible. The reddish lines are the remnants of enlarged blood vessels. This medical condition of enlarged blood vessels is called telangiectasias. 

The ocular rosaceatic subtype causes inflammation and irritation of the eyelids. It can lead to blurry vision, and in extreme cases; it can lead to temporary blindness. 

Treatment of Rosacea 
The appropriate treatment technique for a rosaceatic inflammation depends on the subtype and severity. Even though, it is not recommended, some people leave mild cases untreated. Sometimes, they disguise the symptoms by applying makeup on the affected area. 

Moderate and severe cases can be treated with medication, laser surgery or topical agents. 

Trigger avoidance is the first step in any treatment. Trigger avoidance consists of modifying your behavior in such a way as to minimize your exposure to factors that provoke rosaceatic eruptions. 

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the triggers which, you must avoid: excessive exposure to sunlight, emotional stress, anxiety, depression, sunburns, hot weather, cold weather, windy conditions, strenuous exercise, alcohol consumption, red wine, spicy foods, humidity, indoor heat, certain skin care products, heated beverages, certain cosmetics, marinated meat, steroids and histamine-rich foods. 

Medication consist of topical and oral antibiotics. 

The most frequently prescribed oral antibiotics include tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline. Metronidazole is the most frequently prescribed topical antibiotic. 

Antibiotics are effective in treating the inflammatory rosaceatic subtypes. Subtypes such as papulopustular and phymatous rosacea respond well to antibiotics. These subtypes are characterized by red bumps (papules) and pus-filled pustules. 

A shortcoming of antibiotics is their inability to kill skin bacteria. Both oral and topical antibiotics have this disadvantage. Furthermore, antibiotics need to be used for months before you can expect to start seeing the effects. 

As with all chemicals, you should avoid long-term use. People with a history of kidney diseases may not use tetracycline antibiotics because the antibiotics tend to re-ignite the kidney problems. 

Furthermore, these antibiotics are not for pregnant women or women that are breastfeeding as they can be the source of birth defects for unborn babies. 

Be honest with your dermatologist and reveal any allergies or medical problems that you may have. Using these antibiotics while you have medical problems can lead to the aggravation of your situation. 

Laser surgery is increasingly popular in treatment of rosacea. 

Laser surgery is effective for vascular rosaceatic subtypes like fulminans and erythematotelangiectatic. During a treatment session, intense pulsed light lasers are beamed through the epidermis to the oxy-hemoglobin of the cells of the dermis. 

The structure of the infected oxy-hemoglobin is destroyed, when heated over 75 °C (158 °F). The destruction of the oxy-hemoglobin causes the walls of the capillaries to break down. You will need several laser treatment sessions to achieve full remission. 

Rosacea Home Care Remedy 
Revitol rosacea cream is a top of the line over-the-counter homeopathic treatment. The effectiveness and high safety standards of the revitol formula is widely extolled in the dermatological community. 

The revitol formula contains anti-inflammatory ingredients that treat telangiectasias. Telangiectasias is the condition that is responsible for the red, spidery lines that run across your face. The anti-inflammatory ingredients of revitol treats this problem by constricting the blood vessels near the surface of the skin. 

Rosaceatic outbreaks weaken the ability of your skin to produce its natural protective film of oil. Revitol contains ingredients that stimulate your skin to naturally produce oil. 

Your skin may become dry and flaky due to the nature of rosaceatic disorder. The collagen boosting ingredients in revitol hydrate and moisturize your skin. This helps prevent any bacteria from aggravating your condition. 

The potent and all-natural revitol formula guarantees proven health results. Order the clinically approved revitol formula now and eradicate your rosacea.

FW14-e122-7250-05	"Most people get too much sodium in their diet. 

Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.  The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that hypertension-related diseases result in 26.9% of developed countries' deaths, and 21.6% of underdeveloped countries' deaths.  High blood pressure (hypertension) is experienced by 90% of people at some point in their life and is a major contributor to heart attacks and strokes.  The WHO website says that daily intake of more than 2000 mg of sodium or less than 3500 mg potassium can cause hypertension  ► http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2013/salt_potassium_20130131/en/. 

Here is an informative video about salt from CDC ► Salt Matters: Preserving Choice, Protecting Health.  About 75% of salt intake is from processed and restaurant foods.  Buying the foods with no sodium helps:).  Most people get enough sodium from natural foods, no salt is needed. It is best to cook at home with no salt added in a pressure cooker (it is the fastest cooking method - up to 5 times faster - and it retains up to 9 times more anti-oxidants, vitamins), while avoiding eating restaurant and canned salty foods (metals can leak into the foods).  Also, draining the liquid in canned salty foods can often remove almost half the sodium.  Harvard School of Public Health has more salt studies ► http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/salt-and-heart-disease/. 

We only need 200-1200 mg of sodium, depending on weight and activity levels (sweating eliminates sodium).  Potassium relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, while sodium tenses blood vessels and increases BP.  Also, too much sodium can damage the bones ► http://healthyliving.msn.com/diseases/osteoporosis/potassium-and-sodium-the-dynamic-duo-1. 

When using a lot of salt, it is even more important to blood pressure control to limit the intake of sugar (sucrose) and fructose. Studies show those consuming too many simple sugars [sweet fruits (rich in fructose) or processed foods with added high fructose corn syrup or sugar] have higher blood pressure ►http://www.medpagetoday.com/Cardiology/Hypertension/21000. 
Some recommend eating less than 15 g of fructose a day, less than half a banana.  No sodas or drinks with added sugar ► http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/05/25/startling-research-findings-a-newly-discovered-cause-of-high-blood-pressure-and-obesity.aspx. "" In 1892, there were just two cases of diabetes per 100,000 people, according to a famous medical textbook by Sir William Osler, The Principles and Practice of Medicine. Today, the rate is 9 percent across all age groups, and sadly one of every three children is either diabetic or pre-diabetic."" 

High sodium and low potassium intake led to higher mortality in this study ►http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1106080.  When combined with high sugars this high ratio of sodium to potassium leads to serious heart problems. People have noticed a big drop in blood pressure within weeks of changing sugar, sodium and potassium intake.  Many supermarkets sell KCl, potassium chloride salt, so using this kind of salt at home is another way to get more potassium.  Normal salt is sodium chloride, NaCl. 

http://www.nutritiondata.com allows searching foods to see their sugars, potassium and omega 3 fatty acids (unsaturated fat) levels.  Besides decreasing sodium, saturated fat and omega 6 acids intake, increasing omega 3 fatty acids intake lowers blood pressure ► http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/02/27/1221997110. Many people eat omega 6: omega 3 in ratios of 30:1 to 10:1.  The healthier (for blood pressure and also for increased telomere length) ratios are in the range 4:1 to 1:1. Some beans (black, pinto, white, etc) have high potassium and also roughly equal amounts of omega 3 to omega 6. Beans are better than many fried foods with trans fats or oxysterols that clog the arteries.  However, beans have fats too and cooking those fats can cause some harmful fats to emerge, so for diabetics especially it's much better to eat raw unroasted walnuts with omega 3: omega 6 ratio of 1:4 and 400 mg potassium per 100g.  All nuts should be eaten unroasted, since oxidized fats clog the arteries and raise blood pressure. Interestingly, coconut saturated fat eaters have less heart disease than us ► http://coconutoil.com/litalee/.  Sri Lankans used to have the lowest heart disease rate in the world in 1953 when they are 136 coconuts a year on average ► http://www.pca.da.gov.ph/heartdisease.php. 

Too much of whole grains or beans, i.e. too many carbohydrates, can cause an increase in blood pressure long term due to spike in insulin levels, so much so that diets with more monounsaturated fats lead to lower blood pressure ► http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16249527. Insulin levels being high is also how Alzheimer can develop faster. However, among high carbohydrate eaters, eating complex (beans and grains) carbohydrates instead of simple ones (sugar, fructose in fruits) leads to comparatively lower blood pressure ► http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18845707. 

Studies show those eating least meat and dairy have the lowest (healthiest) blood pressure ► http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12372158. It became evident that those eating no red meat are less likely to die of heart disease and they live longer ► http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324423904578523190441042514.html.  The scientifically proven (and covered by Medicare and many private insurance companies) Dr. Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease helped thousands to lower blood pressure through a healthier low fat diet ► http://www.ornishspectrum.com/ornish-certified-site-directory/reversing-programs/. 

Scientists found that good sleep prevents hypertension ► http://healthland.time.com/2011/08/30/could-lack-of-deep-sleep-fuel-high-blood-pressure/, diabetes ► http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120929140234.htm, weak immune system ► http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120701191638.htm and other health problems. During sleep the body does a lot of self-repair.  Meditation, eating as little fat as possible (except for the minimum omega 3 needed), peaceful music (example ► MOUNTAIN STREAM Nature Sounds (10 Hours) Relax, Meditate, Sleep) and emotions, natural diuretics (cucumber, tomatoes, fresh ginger tea, etc), lower stress, avoiding gaining weight, not smoking, not drinking alcohol can also help lower blood pressure. 

Few people know that ginger tea can lower blood pressure by 10 points (► http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15613983 for the mechanics of ginger).  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157513 presents ginger tea effect on blood pressure, while http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16117603 shows anti-inflammatory effects of ginger (boosts immune system).  100g of raw ginger contains 410mg of potassium, about 10% of daily needs.  Ginger is easier to eat as tea, but in many nations it's added to already cooked foods in raw form after cooking.  Raw is more potent.  Ginger has been used for thousands of years as medicine. The studies show the more concentrated the tea or the more ginger we eat, the lower the blood pressure. So, with ginger one can lower the blood pressure by 20 points also: be it as tea made from raw ginger, raw in salads, or added raw before or after cooking foods. 

Hibiscus tea lowers blood pressure too (► http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20018807).  Here is an interesting comparison between teas showing how black tea increases blood pressure while hibiscus tea dramatically decreases blood pressure by 15-20 points ► http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685605. Many stores sell hibiscus flowers in the bulk section. 

The normal pulse rate is 60-100 bpm (beats per minute) and ideal blood pressure is less than 115/75 mm Hg (less than 115 systolic AND less than 75 diastolic) for those older than 18.  Normally they say less than 120/80, but it's always better to aim for lower since it prevents issues decades later.  The best athletes or meditators (who can attain deep peace) can have pulse of 40 and still be in perfect health.  The known world record is 27 bpm.  One can take blood pressure and pulse at home, with one of those $10-40 monitors available at Walmart, etc. In general, the lower the values, the longer the person will live heart disease free.  Studies show that the lower the heart rate the longer we live ► http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20130416/higher-heart-rate-tied-to-earlier-death-even-in-fit-people, independent of whether we exercise or not. Harvard Medical School agrees with this finding ► http://www.health.harvard.edu/press_releases/slower-heart-rate-may-translate-into-longer-life.  Being free from anger lowers heart rate and blood pressure, so staying happy helps:).

FW14-e122-7250-02	"Is Rosacea treatable? 

What is rosacea:  it is a chronic vascular disorder which is exasperated with the presence of certain environmental conditions and the particular genetic make up of the patient. 

A case study done by Dr. David M. Verebelyi shows that patient with rosacea when treated with Intense Pulse Light and a Non-Ablative 1064Nd:Yag in conjunction with the use of antibiotics,   screen and Skin   has shown significant improvement in the overall appearance of the skin and has had lasting results.  This treatment can be performed at Lotus Skin Care Center and Medi-Spa in Massapequa, Massapequa, Long Island New York, 516.798.0200, http://www.lotuslasertreatments.com 

The symptoms are characterized by the vascular telangiectasia and general erythema that are visible on the face, sometimes accompanied with pustules and papules.  There is no unified consensus as what causes this disease.  What is known is that there is a significant increase in Demodex Folliculorum, a hair mite in patients with rosacea.  The hair mites clog glands which lead to the inflammation seen in rosacea patient.  What researchers are also focusing on is the genetics of rosacea patients.  How certain cell receptors affect specific cell’s function in the presence of dust mites antigens and bacterial proteases leading to increase inflammation in the skin. 

What does the Intense Pulse Light and a Non-Ablative 1064Nd:Yag; laser Genesis treatment performed at Lotus Skin Care Center and Medi-Spa in Massapequa, Massapequa, Long Island New York, 516.798.0200, http://www.lotuslasertreatments.com do? 
The Laser Genesis heats up the papillary dermis reaching vessels beyond the reach of the IPL.  As a result the heat stimulates cytokine release and brings fibroblast all over the treated site over the next seven day to ten days, which translates to increase collagen production. This new collagen helps support existing vessels.  As we age, collagen decrease and we begin to sag because of continuous UV exposure and the supporting structure of the coetaneous vessels break down.  This is possibly the reason we see the symptoms of rosacea patient worsen at the age of thirty and over.  Following the use of the Laser Genesis the IPL will be used, which will address the diffuse redness, telangiactatic matting. 
Patients receiving this treatment at Lotus Skin Care Center and Medi-Spa in Massapequa, Massapequa, Long Island New York, 516.798.0200, http://www.lotuslasertreatments.com also urged use Skniceutical Physical Sunscreen and Redness neutralizer.  When these products are used in conjunction with the treatments the redness is controlled and the UV exposure is minimized.

FW14-e122-7307-10	"2008 The Iran Symbol, The Falsifiers and the Republican Prophecy 
LayDayWatchers 

The May 15th Prophecy like a lone voice in the wilderness have been telling you the Beast would rise up from Iran before transferring his seat of power to Iraq, and there would be no European Roman Empire or Gog and Magog happening, because the False Prophets have prophesied things unto you that are False, Fallacious and Fictitious. 

However God is manifesting the truth of the May 15th Prophecy 

Ahmadinejad's visit to Iraq is the first ever by an Iranian president since the end of the bloody war in the 1980s between the two coutnries that left one million people dead 
Iraq and Iran having been deadly enemies, and (Ahmadinejad's visit) shows they have turned a page,"" said Rand Corp. analyst and former U.S. diplomat James Dobbins.Iraq's Shiite power bases — both in top posts and on the streets — will be the most closely watched barometers for any possible changes following the visit. 

Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, and President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, may now have a more direct pipeline to Tehran for dialogue on Shiite trouble spots. 

LastDayWatchers this is the type of information you need to focus on because it revels how God is working the nations, by allowing Satan to establish his Son Kingdom; to fulfill his Word in scripture 

There came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up buy the roots. 

The May 15th Prophecy have been saying what the Prophets of old have been saying about Iran coming to power to dominate from Iraq take a look at this video because it give a glimpse and foreshadow of what the May 15th Prophecy have already prophesied about. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEEvhilOZ8c 

When you have the power you don't need to come under the cover of darkness as the Iranian President pointed out all to well! 

Ahmadinejad: US power crippling in Iraq 

Unlike Bush's trips to Iraq, Ahmadinejad announced his journey in advance, drove in a motorcade down Baghdad's airport road_ once known as ""The Highway of Death 

The visits should be declared and open. And all those who come on stealth visits, we should ask them why they visit this country in a stealth manner?"" Ahmadinejad 

This is another hint or example that shows the failure of the ""surge"" 

A head of state is a symbol of a nation power, the Iranian President visit proves the United States power hold on Iraq is so tenuous their own head of state had to come under the cover of darkness and theirs officials wearing helmets and flat jackets! 

Speaking Of symbols LastDayWatchers did you notice the Iranian symbol?, how many of you know that much of God's Word is better understood by symbols, which is why God uses symbols and symbolism. 

Satan is no stranger to the use of symbols and the important thereof, which is why you see nations throughout history good or bad use symbolism to portray their ideology, advance their cause and promote their culture and systems. 

Take for instance one of the most powerful symbolism of the Cold War and ultimate fall of Communism was made by U.S. President Ronald Reagan. 

With his speech in front of the Berlin Wall he uttered forth the famous word ""Tear Down This Wall"", the Berlin Wall which symbolized the smothering entrapment of communism and the division between democracy and communism. 

The symbol of a democratic head of state to go inside another nation (Germany) who stood at the heart of the cold war divide; to advance the cause for democracy was profound,  it goes without saying that the Berlin Wall came crumbling down AFTER that symbol was made. 

Anyone doing a historical documentary on Ronald Reagan would have done a piss poor job if they didn't included this moment. 

TEAR DOWN THE WALL 

The same is true of the historic visit of Iran President to Iraq, it has been played down in the West because of propaganda that is being used in the false ""war on terror"". 

However spiritually, historical and biblical LastDayWatchers it is of enormous important, with this scriptural and ""facts on the ground"" symbolism; is more proof of God keeping his word to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob by reason of the Prophets especially Habakkuk and Daniel. 

Did not the May 15th Prophecy tell you back on 06-13-07 in the post titled 
(See:The Beast, The Anti-Christ and The Little Horn (The Hidden Iman) 

Iraq by reason of the coming up among the bear position of Iran. 

Is none other then that same demon-spirit through the Uammah; which has been taken over by the same spirit that possessed Alexander the Great, is now in the deception in the form of the Hidden Imam. 

Also remember I warn back on 07-03-07 in the post titled 
(See:Iran and The 3 Horns, No European Roman Revival) 

But Iran is “up among them” horn"" Daniel 7:8 

Iran is “The other which came up, and before whom three fell"" Daniel 7:20 

Iran is the bear with “three rib in it month between the teeth of it"" Daniel 7:5 

Iran is “behold there shall stand up yet three king in Persia"" Daniel 11:2 

Iran is the “Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the 
glory of the kingdom” Daniel 11:20 

That a description of the monarchy rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran 

He shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle” Daniel 11:20 

That a description of his fall to the revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini to replace the monarchy with a Islamic Republic controlled by the mullahs. 

It is that religious mullah government rule that Daniel is referring to when he says 
And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, that vile person is the Anti-Christ 

Just like he did with Alexander the Great he will do with Anti-Christ by starting off in one place before moving his capital and headquarters to Iraq. 
Also back on 07-12-07 in the post titled(See:Iran-Iraq and the 10 who give power to the Hidden Imam) 

The May 15 Prophecy pointed you to the fact that Iran from it “bear” feet position noted in Revelation 13:2"" 

And his feet were as the feet of a bear 

Would rise up and strike with its paws 3 nations that are part of the 10-horn kingdom which are Horn-Rib #1 Iraq"" 

LastDayWatchers can you see how correct the May 15th Prophecy have been because it is the truth of God Word, equally can you also see how false and fallacious a Gog and Magog (which Iraq have no part of) is full of lies repeated by the false prophets 

(See:May 15th chronicle, the Armenian Genocide and Woe to the False Prophets) 

Do you actually think that U.N General Secretary Ban Ki Moon is leading a conspiracy to unite a European Union to bring down Israel? (lol), if so how can we ""Watch"" such action?, can you see how absurd God's Word get treated by these false prophets? 

(See:The Fire Starter, The Perfect Position and The Ominous Reminder) 

The May 15th Prophecy ask you to read the book of Lamentations, if you did your homework you would know that Lamentations is the voice of Israel (The House of Judah) during the Great Tribulation, it describes the characteristics of these false prophets relationship to them. 

Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee 
The Septuagint translate it 

Thy Prophets saw vanities and follies for thee 
The Bible an American translation (J.M.Powis Smith and Edgar Goodspeed) translate it 

Your Prophets have divined for you stuff and nonsense 
The living Bible Paraphrased (Kenneth Taylor) translate it 

Your Prophets have said so many foolish things, false to the core 
The New English Bible translate it 

The vision that your prophets saw for you were false and painted sham 

LastDayWatchers it will be the Spirit of Iniquity that will possess the False Prophet and the spirit of the Son of Satan will posses Anti-Christ and these two in unison will deceive the worlds 

The May 15th Prophecy will go into more detail of the difference of these two entity and will show you exactly who the False Prophet is just as I shown you who the Beast is in future post. 

But now I want to know that the Spirit of Iniquity who the May 15th Prophecy have shown is the working force behind the Ummah 
(See:Ummah and Shadows of the Uprooting) 

The spirit is not limited to the activity of the Ummah put is also the primary and driving force behind the Religious Right Conservatism. 

You can discern them by their lies and false since of support for Israel (the House of Judah). 

They will tell you things like Judah is surrounded by ""Islamic Fascists” that why you must stand against this evil. (Hint: support war on terror) 

They will tell you Israel is good, and ""Radical Islam"" is bad, and God is on the side of Israel. 

That why they preach the false doctrine of Gog and Magog to promote the idea that God is going to wipe out Iran and Russia while still leaving Israel standing. (Hint: the war on terror will achieve victory over Islamic fascism) 

Then they tell Israel itchy ear that Islam will be defeated and their only worry is a ""European"" Rome empire but that threat is far in the future, they do this all in the name of ""Patriotism"" to win the false ""war on terror"" 

Thus saith the Word of God  ""All who preach this false doctrine shall drink the water of gall"" 

The real truth of God's Word is in the May 15th Prophecy which have already declared unto you that Israel (the house of Judah) will be overran and plunder by the kingdom of the Beast they will utterly lose the ""war on terror"" 

The continuation of the Lamentation 2:14 verse declare the difference between the May 15th Prophecy and the falsifying false prophets (Hal Lindsey, John Woolvard, Tim LeHaye, John Hagee , Jack Van Empee and Joel Rosenberg, Benny Hin...est.) just to name a few. 

Listen to what Lamentation have to say about these false prophet who scratch the ear of Israel (the House of Judah) 

They have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment. 

The New International Version translate it 

They did not expose your sin, to ward off your captivity. The oracles they gave you were false and misleading 

The New Living Translation Tyndale Charitable Trust translate it 
They did not try to hold you back from exile by pointing out your sins. Instead, they painted false pictures, filling you with false hope. 

The Jerusalem Bible translate it 
They never pointed out your sin to ward off your exile, the visions they proffered you were false, fallacious, misleading 

And the American bible (Kenneth Taylor) translate it best 
They have not tried to hold you back from slavery by pointing out your sins, they lied and said all was well 

There you have it LastDayWatchers now you see why the hypercritical bastards preach a Gog and Magog and European Rome to sell you painted shams and raise money for support of Israel (the House of Judah) 

However the May 15th Prophecy declares what will shortly occur with 100% accuracy, you LastDayWatchers already know that God has cursed the United States (the House of Manasseh) by reason of George W Bush. 

The Lord of Host has cursed him, his household (including his political house affiliation), the White House and the entire Nation. 

Thus saith the Word of Gods 

There will be no peace for the house of Judah, only violence during your Administration as a testimony against you 

Your political house will suffer defeat as a testimony against thine unclean hands, they will suffer defeat in the House, they will suffer defeat in the Senate 

And because John McCain has embraced thine unclean hands he will be utterly defeated a testimony against you 

Before you democrats get to giddy let the May 15th Prophecy also remind you that the Lord of Host curse is still in affect which says from Gods own mouth 

You shall be only oppressed and plundered continually, and no one shall save you. 

Until we blog again ""watch"" more proof of the 100% accuracy of the May 15th Prophecy about the dark cloud that is brewing over Lebanon. 

USS Cole 'ordered to position off Lebanese coast' 

BEIRUT: A US Navy warship has been ordered to take up station off Lebanon's coast as a ""show of support"" as the standoff between Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's government and the opposition continues 

Lebanon: What are they waiting for? 

It's just time-wasting until a war happens,"" said Amal Saad- Ghorayeb, a Hezbollah expert at the Carnegie Endowment Middle East Centre in Beirut. 

There's a regional war coming and things are going to change dramatically."" A meeting at the weekend between Mubarak and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia appeared calculated to up the pressure on Syria and show a united front.

#armeniangenocide 

The Armenian Genocide (Armenian: Հայոց Ցեղասպանություն, translit.: Hayoc’ C’eġaspanowt’yown; Turkish: Ermeni Soykırımı), also known as the Armenian Holocaust, the Armenian Massacres and, by Armenians, as the Great Calamity (Մեծ Եղեռն, Meç Eġeṙn, Armenian pronunciation: [mɛts jɛˈʁɛrn]), was the deliberate and systematic destruction (genocide) of the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire during and just after World War I. It was characterised by the use of massacres, and the use of deportations involving forced marches under conditions designed to lead to the death of the deportees, with the total number of Armenian deaths generally held to have been between one and one-and-a-half million. Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination. 

It is widely acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides, as many Western sources point to the systematic, organized manner in which the killings were carried out to eliminate the Armenians.[9] Indeed, the word genocide was coined in order to describe these events. 

The date of the onset of the genocide is conventionally held to be April 24, 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities arrested some 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople. Thereafter, the Ottoman military uprooted Armenians from their homes and forced them to march for hundreds of miles, depriving them of food and water, to the desert of what is now Syria. Massacres were indiscriminate of age or gender, with rape and other sexual abuse commonplace. The Armenian Genocide is the second most-studied case of genocide after the Holocaust. 

The Republic of Turkey, the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, denies the word genocide is an accurate description of the events. In recent years, it has faced repeated calls to accept the events as genocide. To date, twenty countries have officially recognized the events of the period as genocide, and most genocide scholars and historians accept this view. The majority of Armenian diaspora communities were founded as a result of the Armenian genocide. 

Prelude 

Life under Ottoman rule 

Armenian-populated regions in central and eastern Anatolia and the Transcaucasus before the genocide. 
The majority of the Armenian population was concentrated in the east of the Ottoman Empire.In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the Muslim dhimmi system, Armenians, as Christians, were guaranteed limited freedoms (such as the right to worship), but were treated as second-class citizens. Christians and Jews were not considered equals to Muslims: testimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law. They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses, their houses could not overlook those of Muslims, and their religious practices would have to defer to those of Muslims, in addition to various other legal limitations. Violation of these statutes could result in punishments ranging from the levying of fines to execution. 

The three major European powers, Great Britain, France and Russia (known as the Great Powers), took issue with the Empire's treatment of its Christian minorities and increasingly pressured the Ottoman government (also known as the Sublime Porte) to extend equal rights to all its citizens. Beginning in 1839, the Ottoman government implemented the Tanzimat reforms to improve the situation of minorities, although these would prove largely ineffective. By the late 1870s, Greece, along with several countries of the Balkans, frustrated with conditions, had, often with the help of the Powers, broken free of Ottoman rule. Armenians, for the most part, remained passive during these years, earning them the title of millet-i sadıka or the ""loyal millet."" 

Reform implementation, 1860s–1880s 

In the mid-1860s to early 1870s, Armenians began to ask for better treatment from the Ottoman government. After amassing the signatures of peasants from eastern Anatolia, the Armenian Communal Council had petitioned to the Ottoman government to redress the issues that the peasants complained about: ""the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] Kurds and Circassians, improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial."" The Ottoman government considered these grievances and promised to punish those responsible. 

Following the violent suppression of Christians in the uprisings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Serbia in 1875, the Great Powers invoked the 1856 Treaty of Paris by claiming that it gave them the right to intervene and protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities. Under growing pressure, the government declared itself a constitutional monarchy (which was almost immediately dissolved) and entered into negotiations with the powers. At the same time, the Armenian patriarchate of Constantinople, Nerses II, forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread ""forced land seizure ... forced conversion of women and children, arson, protection extortion, rape, and murder"" to the Powers. 

After the conclusion of the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, Armenians began to look more towards Tsarist Russia as the guarantors of their security. Nerses approached the Russian leadership during its negotiations with the Ottomans in San Stefano and in the eponymous treaty, convinced them to insert a clause, Article 16, that stipulated that Russian forces occupying the Armenian provinces would only withdraw with the full implementation of Ottoman reforms. Great Britain was troubled with Russia holding on to so much Ottoman territory and forced it to enter into new negotiations with the convening of the Congress of Berlin on June 13, 1878. Armenians also entered into these negotiations and stated that they sought autonomy, not independence from the Ottoman Empire. They partially succeeded as Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin contained the same text as Article 16 but removed any mention that Russian forces would remain in the provinces; instead, the Ottoman government was to periodically inform the Great Powers of the progress of the reforms. 

Hamidian Massacres, 1894–1896 

Hamidian massacresIn 1876, the Ottoman government was led by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. From the beginning of the reform period after the signing of the Berlin treaty, Hamid II attempted to stall their implementation and asserted that Armenians did not make up a majority in the provinces and that Armenian reports of abuses were largely exaggerated or false. In 1890, Hamid II created a paramilitary outfit known as the Hamidiye which was made up of Kurdish irregulars who were tasked to ""deal with the Armenians as they wished."" As Ottoman officials intentionally provoked rebellions (often as a result of over-taxation) in Armenian populated towns, such as the Sasun Resistance of 1894, these regiments were increasingly used to deal with the Armenians by way of oppression and massacre. Armenians successfully fought off the regiments and brought the excesses to the attention of the Great Powers in 1895 who subsequently condemned the Porte. 

The Powers forced Hamid to sign a new reform package designed to curtail the powers of the Hamidiye in October 1895 which like the Berlin treaty, was never implemented. On October 1, 1895, 2,000 Armenians assembled in Constantinople to petition for the implementation of the reforms but Ottoman police units converged towards the rally and violently broke it up.Soon, massacres of Armenians broke out in Constantinople and then engulfed the rest of the Armenian populated provinces of Bitlis, Diyarbekir, Harput, Sivas, Trabzon and Van. Estimates differ on how many Armenians were killed but European documentation of the violence, which became known as the Hamidian massacres, placed the figures from anywhere between 100,000–300,000 Armenians. 

Although Hamid was never directly implicated for ordering the massacres, he was suspected for their tacit approval and for not acting to end them. Frustrated with European indifference to the massacres, Armenians from the Dashnaktsutiun political party seized the European managed Ottoman Bank on August 26, 1896. This incident brought further sympathy for Armenians in Europe and was lauded by the European and American press, which vilified Hamid and painted him as the ""great assassin"" and ""bloody Sultan."" While the Great Powers vowed to take action and enforce new reforms, these never came into fruition due to conflicting political and economic interests. 

Dissolution of the Empire 

Young Turk Revolution, 1908 

On July 24, 1908, Armenians' hopes for equality in the empire brightened once more when a coup d'état staged by officers in the Turkish Third Army based in Salonika removed Hamid II from power and restored the country back to a constitutional monarchy. The officers were part of the Young Turk movement that wanted to reform administration of the decadent state of the Ottoman Empire and modernize it to European standards. The movement was an anti-Hamidian coalition made up of two distinct groups: the secular liberal constitutionalists and the nationalists; the former was more democratic and accepted Armenians into their wing whereas the latter was more intolerant in regard to Armenian-related issues and their frequent requests for European assistance. In 1902, during a congress of the Young Turks held in Paris, the heads of the liberal wing, Sabahheddin Bey and Ahmed Riza, partially persuaded the nationalists to include in their objectives to ensure some rights to all the minorities of the empire. 

Among the numerous factions of the Young Turks also included the political organization Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). Originally a secret society made up of army officers based in Salonika, the CUP proliferated amongst military circles as more army mutinies took place throughout the empire. In 1908, elements of the Third Army and the Second Army Corps declared their opposition to the Sultan and threatened to march on the capital to depose him. Hamid, shaken by the wave of resentment, stepped down from power as Armenians, Greeks, Arabs, Bulgarians and Turks alike rejoiced in his dethronement. 

Adana Massacre, 1909 

An Armenian town left pillaged and destroyed after the massacres in Adana in 1909.A countercoup took place on April 13, 1909. Some Ottoman military elements, joined by Islamic theological students, aimed to return control of the country to the Sultan and the rule of Islamic law. Riots and fighting broke out between the reactionary forces and CUP forces, until the CUP was able to put down the uprising and court-martial the opposition leaders. 

While the movement initially targeted the nascent Young Turk government, it spilled over into pogroms against Armenians who were perceived as having supported the restoration of the constitution. When Ottoman Army troops were called in, many accounts record that instead of trying to quell the violence they actually took part in pillaging Armenian enclaves in Adana province. 15,000–30,000 Armenians were killed in the course of the ""Adana Massacre"". 

Armenian Genocide, 1915–1917 period 

In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers. Minister of War Enver Pasha developed a plan to encircle and destroy the Russian Caucasus Army at Sarıkamış, to regain territories lost to Russia after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. Enver Pasha's forces were routed at the Battle of Sarikamis, and almost completely destroyed. Returning to Constantinople, Enver publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians living in the region actively siding with the Russians 

Labor battalions, February 25 
Further information: Labour battalions 
On February 25, 1915, The War minister Enver Pasha sent an order to all military units that Armenians in the active Ottoman forces be demobilized and assigned to the unarmed Labour battalion (Turkish: amele taburlari). Enver Pasha explained this decision as ""out of fear that they would collaborate with the Russians"". As a tradition, the Ottoman Army drafted non-Muslim males only between the ages of 20 and 45 into the regular army. The younger (15–20) and older (45–60) non-Muslim soldiers had always been used as logistical support through the labor battalions. Before February, some of the Armenian recruits were utilized as laborers (hamals), though they would ultimately be executed. 

Transferring Armenian conscripts from active field (armed) to passive, unarmed logistic section was an important aspect of the subsequent genocide. As reported in ""The Memoirs of Naim Bey"", the extermination of the Armenians in these battalions was part of a premeditated strategy on behalf of the Committee of Union and Progress. Many of these Armenian recruits were executed by local Turkish gangs. 

Events at Van, April 1915 
Further information: Van Resistance 

Armed Armenian civilians and self-defense units holding a line against Turkish forces in the walled city of Van in May 1915On April 19, 1915, Jevdet Bey demanded that the city of Van immediately furnish him 4,000 soldiers under the pretext of conscription. However, it was clear to the Armenian population that his goal was to massacre the able-bodied men of Van so that there would be no defenders.Jevdet Bey had already used his official writ in nearby villages, ostensibly to search for arms, which had turned into wholesale massacres. The Armenians offered five hundred soldiers and to pay exemption money for the rest in order to buy time, however, Djevdet accused Armenians of ""rebellion,"" and spoke of his determination to ""crush"" it at any cost. ""If the rebels fire a single shot,"" he declared, ""I shall kill every Christian man, woman, and"" (pointing to his knee) ""every child, up to here."" 

On April 20, 1915, the armed conflict of the Van Resistance began when an Armenian woman was harassed, and the two Armenian men that came to her aid were killed by Turkish soldiers. The Armenian defenders protected 30,000 residents and 15,000 refugees in an area of roughly one square kilometer of the Armenian Quarter and suburb of Aigestan with 1,500 able bodied riflemen who were supplied with 300 rifles and 1,000 pistols and antique weapons. The conflict lasted until General Yudenich came to rescue them. 

Arrest and deportation of Armenian notables, April 1915 

Armenian intellectuals who were arrested and later executed en masse by Ottoman authorities on the night of April 24, 1915.By 1914, Ottoman authorities had already begun a propaganda drive to present Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire as a threat to the empire's security. An Ottoman naval officer in the War Office described the planning: 

In order to justify this enormous crime the requisite propaganda material was thoroughly prepared in Constantinople. [It included such statements as] ""the Armenians are in league with the enemy. They will launch an uprising in Istanbul, kill off the Committee of Union and Progress leaders and will succeed in opening the straits (of the Dardanelles)."" 

On the night of April 24, 1915, the Ottoman government rounded-up and imprisoned an estimated 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. This date coincided with Allied troop landings at Gallipoli after unsuccessful Allied naval attempts to break through the Dardanelles to Constantinople in February and March 1915. 

Temporary Law of Deportation (the ""Tehcir"" law) 

In May 1915, Mehmed Talat Pasha requested that the cabinet and Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha legalize a measure for relocation and settlement of Armenians to other places due to what Talat Pasha called ""the Armenian riots and massacres, which had arisen in a number of places in the country."" However, Talat Pasha was referring specifically to events in Van and extending the implementation to the regions in which alleged ""riots and massacres"" would affect the security of the war zone of the Caucasus Campaign. Later, the scope of the immigration was widened in order to include the Armenians in the other provinces. On 29 May 1915, the CUP Central Committee passed the Temporary Law of Deportation (""Tehcir Law""), giving the Ottoman government and military authorization to deport anyone it ""sensed"" as a threat to national security. The ""Tehcir Law"" brought some measures regarding the property of the deportees, but during September a new law was proposed. By means of the ""Abandoned Properties"" Law (Law Concerning Property, Dept's and Assets Left Behind Deported Persons, also referred as the ""Temporary Law on Expropriation and Confiscation""), the Ottoman government took possession of all ""abandoned"" Armenian goods and properties. Ottoman parliamentary representative Ahmed Riza protested this legislation: 

It is unlawful to designate the Armenian assets as “abandoned goods” for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily removed from their domiciles and exiled. Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods... If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can’t do this. This is atrocious. Grab my arm, eject me from my village, then sell my goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible. Neither the conscience of the Ottomans nor the law can allow it. 
On 13 September 1915, the Ottoman parliament passed the ""Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation"", stating that all property, including land, livestock, and homes belonging to Armenians, was to be confiscated by the authorities. 

Deportation and extermination process 

With the implementation of Tehcir law, the confiscation of Armenian property and the slaughter of Armenians that ensued upon the law's enactment outraged much of the western world. While the Ottoman Empire's wartime allies offered little protest, a wealth of German and Austrian historical documents has since come to attest to the witnesses' horror at the killings and mass starvation of Armenians. In the United States, The New York Times reported almost daily on the mass murder of the Armenian people, describing the process as ""systematic"", ""authorized"" and ""organized by the government."" Theodore Roosevelt would later characterize this as ""the greatest crime of the war."" 

The Armenians were marched out to the Syrian town of Deir ez-Zor and the surrounding desert. A good deal of evidence suggests that the Ottoman government did not provide any facilities or supplies to sustain the Armenians during their deportation, nor when they arrived. By August 1915, The New York Times repeated an unattributed report that ""the roads and the Euphrates are strewn with corpses of exiles, and those who survive are doomed to certain death. It is a plan to exterminate the whole Armenian people."" 

Ottoman troops escorting the Armenians not only allowed others to rob, kill, and rape the Armenians, but often participated in these activities themselves.Deprived of their belongings and marched into the desert, hundreds of thousands of Armenians perished. 

Naturally, the death rate from starvation and sickness is very high and is increased by the brutal treatment of the authorities, whose bearing toward the exiles as they are being driven back and forth over the desert is not unlike that of slave drivers. With few exceptions no shelter of any kind is provided and the people coming from a cold climate are left under the scorching desert sun without food and water. Temporary relief can only be obtained by the few able to pay officials. 

It is believed that 25 major concentration camps existed, under the command of Şükrü Kaya, one of the right hand-men of Talat Pasha. The majority of the camps were situated near Turkey's modern Iraqi and Syrian borders, and some were only temporary transit camps. Others, such as Radjo, Katma, and Azaz, are said to have been used only temporarily, for mass graves; these sites were vacated by autumn 1915. Some authors also maintain that the camps Lale, Tefridje, Dipsi, Del-El, and Ra's al-'Ain were built specifically for those who had a life expectancy of a few days. 

Although nearly all the camps, including the primary sites, were open air, the remainder of the mass killing in minor camps was not limited to direct killings, but also to mass burning. Eitan Belkind was a Nili member, who infiltrated the Ottoman army as an official. He was assigned to the headquarters of Camal Pasha. He claims to have witnessed the burning of 5,000 Armenians. Lt. Hasan Maruf, of the Ottoman army, describes how a population of a village were taken all together, and then burned. The Commander of the Third Army Vehib's 12-page affidavit, which was dated 5 December 1918, was presented in the Trabzon trial series (March 29, 1919) included in the Key Indictment, reporting such a mass burning of the population of an entire village near Mush. that in Bitlis, Mus and Sassoun, The shortest method for disposing of the women and children concentrated in tile various camps was to burn them. And also that, Turkish prisoners who had apparently witnessed some of these scenes were horrified and maddened at the remembering the sight. They told the Russians that the stench of the burning human flesh permeated the air for many days after. The Germans, Ottoman allies, also witnessed the way Armenians were burned according to the Israeli historian, Bat Ye’or, who writes: The Germans, allies of the Turks in the First World War, ...saw how civil populations were shut up in churches and burned, or gathered en masse in camps, tortured to death, and reduced to ashes,... 

During the Trabzon trial series of the Martial court, from the sittings between March 26 and May 17, 1919, the Trabzons Health Services Inspector Dr. Ziya Fuad wrote in a report that Dr. Saib caused the death of children with the injection of morphine. The information was allegedly provided by two physicians (Drs. Ragib and Vehib), both Dr. Saib's colleagues at Trabzons Red Crescent hospital, where those atrocities were said to have been committed. Dr. Ziya Fuad and Dr. Adnan, public health services director of Trabzon, submitted affidavits reporting cases in which two school buildings were used to organize children and send them to the mezzanine to kill them with toxic gas equipment . 
The Ottoman surgeon, Dr. Haydar Cemal wrote on the order of the Chief Sanitation Office of the IIIrd Army in January 1916, when the spread of typhus was an acute problem, innocent Armenians slated for deportation at Erzican were inoculated with the blood of typhoid fever patients without rendering that blood ‘inactive’.Jeremy Hugh Baron writes : Individual doctors were directly involved in the massacres, having poisoned infants, killed children and issued false certificates of death from natural causes. Nazim's brother-in-law Dr. Tevfik Rushdu, Inspector-General of Health Services, organized the disposal of Armenian corpses with thousands of kilos of lime over six months; he became foreign secretary from 1925 to 1938.The psychiatrist, Robert Jay Lifton, writes in a parenthesis when introducing the crimes of Nazi doctors Perhaps Turkish doctors, in their participation in the genocide against the Armenians, come closest, as I shall later suggest. Oscar S. Heizer, the American consul at Trabzon, reports: This plan did not suit Nail Bey.... Many of the children were loaded into boats and taken out to sea and thrown overboard. The Italian consul of Trabzon in 1915, Giacomo Gorrini, writes: I saw thousands of innocent women and children placed on boats which were capsized in the Black Sea. Hoffman Philip, the American Charge at Constantinople chargé d'affaires, writes: Boat loads sent from Zor down the river arrived at Ana, one thirty miles away, with three fifths of passengers missing. The Trabzon trials reported Armenians having been drowned in the Black Sea. 

Teşkilat-i Mahsusa 

The Committee of Union and Progress founded a ""special organization"" (Turkish: Teşkilat-i Mahsusa) that participated in the destruction of the Ottoman Armenian community. This organization adopted its name in 1913 and functioned like a special forces outfit, or the later Einsatzgruppen. Later in 1914, the Ottoman government influenced the direction the special organization was to take by releasing criminals from central prisons to be the central elements of this newly formed special organization. According to the Mazhar commissions attached to the tribunal as soon as November 1914, 124 criminals were released from Pimian prison. Little by little from the end of 1914 to the beginning of 1915, hundreds, then thousands of prisoners were freed to form the members of this organization. Later, they were charged to escort the convoys of Armenian deportees.Vehib Pasha, commander of the Ottoman Third Army, called those members of the special organization, the “butchers of the human species. 

Contemporaneous reports and reactions 

Of this photo, the United States ambassador wrote , ""Scenes like this were common all over the Armenian provinces, in the spring and summer months of 1915. Death in its several forms—massacre, starvation, exhaustion—destroyed the larger part of the refugees. The Turkish policy was that of extermination under the guise of deportation."" 
Hundreds of eyewitnesses, including the neutral United States and the Ottoman Empire's own allies, Germany and Austria-Hungary, recorded and documented numerous acts of state-sponsored massacres. Many foreign officials offered to intervene on behalf of the Armenians, including Pope Benedict XV, only to be turned away by Ottoman government officials who claimed they were retaliating against a pro-Russian insurrection. On May 24, 1915, the Triple Entente warned the Ottoman Empire that ""In view of these new crimes of Turkey against humanity and civilization, the Allied Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such massacres."" 

The American Committee for Relief in the Near East (ACRNE, or ""Near East Relief"") was a charitable organization established to relieve the suffering of the peoples of the Near East. The organization was championed by Henry Morgenthau, Sr., American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Morgenthau's dispatches on the mass slaughter of Armenians galvanized much support for ACRNE. 

U.S. mission in the Ottoman Empire 

The United States had several consulates throughout the Ottoman Empire, including locations in Edirne, Kharput, Samsun, Smyrna, Trebizond, Van, Constantinople, and Aleppo. The United States was officially a neutral party until it joined with the Allies in 1917. As the orders for deportations and massacres were enacted, many consular officials reported to the ambassador what they were witnessing. In September 1915 the American consul in Kharput, Leslie Davis, reported his discovery of the bodies of nearly 10,000 Armenians dumped into several ravines near Lake Göeljuk, later referring to this region as the ""slaughterhouse province"". 

A telegram sent by Ambassador Henry Morgenthau Sr. to the State Department on 16 July 1915 describes the massacres as a ""campaign of race extermination.""

An article by the New York Times dated 15 December 1915 states that one million Armenians had been either deported or executed by the Ottoman government. 
Workers of the American Committee for Relief in the Near East in Sivas. 
Similar reports reached Morgenthau from Aleppo and Van, prompting him to raise the issue in person with Talaat and Enver. As he quoted to them the testimonies of his consulate officials, they justified the deportations as necessary to the conduct of the war, suggesting that complicity of the Armenians of Van with the Russian forces that had taken the city justified the persecution of all ethnic Armenians. In his memoirs, Morgenthau wrote, ""When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact..."" 

In addition to the consulates, there were also numerous Protestant missionary compounds established in Armenian-populated regions, including Van and Kharput. In memoirs and reports, their staff vividly described the brutal methods used by Ottoman forces and documented numerous instances of atrocities committed against the Christian minority. 

The events were reported regularly in newspapers and literary journals around the world. Many Americans spoke out against the Genocide, including former president Theodore Roosevelt, rabbi Stephen Wise, William Jennings Bryan, and Alice Stone Blackwell. The American Near East Relief Committee helped donate over $110 million to the Armenians. In the United States and the United Kingdom, children were regularly reminded to clean their plates while eating and to ""remember the starving Armenians"". 

Allied forces in the Middle East 

On the Middle Eastern front, the British military engaged Ottoman forces in southern Syria and Mesopotamia. British diplomat Gertrude Bell filed the following report after hearing the account of a captured Ottoman soldier: 

The battalion left Aleppo on 3 February and reached Ras al-Ain in twelve hours... some 12,000 Armenians were concentrated under the guardianship of some hundred Kurds... These Kurds were called gendarmes, but in reality mere butchers; bands of them were publicly ordered to take parties of Armenians, of both sexes, to various destinations, but had secret instructions to destroy the males, children and old women... One of these gendarmes confessed to killing 100 Armenian men himself... the empty desert cisterns and caves were also filled with corpses... 

Reacting to numerous eyewitness accounts, British politician Viscount Bryce and historian Arnold J. Toynbee compiled statements from survivors and eyewitnesses from other countries including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland, who similarly attested to the systematized massacring of innocent Armenians by Ottoman government forces. In 1916, they published The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915–1916. Although the book has since been criticized as British wartime propaganda to build up sentiment against the Central Powers, Bryce had submitted the work to scholars for verification before its publication. University of Oxford Regius Professor Gilbert Murray stated of the tome, ""...the evidence of these letters and reports will bear any scrutiny and overpower any skepticism. Their genuineness is established beyond question."" Other professors, including Herbert Fisher of Sheffield University and former American Bar Association president Moorfield Storey, affirmed the same conclusion. 

Winston Churchill described the massacres as an ""administrative holocaust"" and noted that ""the clearance of the race from Asia Minor was about as complete as such an act, on a scale so great, could well be. [...] There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was planned and executed for political reasons. The opportunity presented itself for clearing Turkish soil of a Christian race opposed to all Turkish ambitions, cherishing national ambitions that could only be satisfied at the expense of Turkey, and planted geographically between Turkish and Caucasian Moslems. 

Joint Austrian and German mission 

As allies during the war, the Imperial German mission in the Ottoman Empire included both military and civilian components. Germany had brokered a deal with the Sublime Porte to commission the building of a railroad stretching from Berlin to the Middle East, called the Baghdad Railway. 

Among the most famous persons to document the massacres was German military medic Armin T. Wegner. Wegner defied state censorship in taking hundreds of photographs of Armenians being deported and subsequently starving in northern Syrian camps.[90] 

German officers stationed in eastern Turkey disputed the government's assertion that Armenian revolts had broken out, suggesting that the areas were ""quiet until the deportations began."" 

Germany's diplomatic mission was led by Ambassador Baron Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim (and later Count Paul Wolff Metternich). Like Morgenthau, von Wangenheim received many disturbing messages from consul officials around the Ottoman Empire. From the province of Adana, Consul Eugene Buge reported that the CUP chief had sworn to kill and massacre any Armenians who survived the deportation marches. In June 1915, von Wangenheim sent a cable to Berlin reporting that Talat had admitted the deportations were not ""being carried out because of 'military considerations alone.'"" One month later, he came to the conclusion that there ""no longer was doubt that the Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race in the Turkish Empire."" 

When Wolff-Metternich succeeded von Wangenheim, he continued to dispatch similar cables: ""The Committee [CUP] demands the extirpation of the last remnants of the Armenians and the government must yield.... A Committee representative is assigned to each of the provincial administrations.... Turkification means license to expel, to kill or destroy everything that is not Turkish."" 

German engineers and laborers involved in building the railway also witnessed Armenians being crammed into cattle cars and shipped along the railroad line. Franz Gunther, a representative for Deutsche Bank which was funding the construction of the Baghdad Railway, forwarded photographs to his directors and expressed his frustration at having to remain silent amid such ""bestial cruelty"".[95] Major General Otto von Lossow, acting military attaché and head of the German Military Plenipotentiary in the Ottoman Empire, spoke to Ottoman intentions in a conference held in Batum in 1918: 

The Turks have embarked upon the ""total extermination of the Armenians in Transcaucasia... The aim of Turkish policy is, as I have reiterated, the taking of possession of Armenian districts and the extermination of the Armenians. Talaat's government wants to destroy all Armenians, not just in Turkey but also outside Turkey. On the basis of all the reports and news coming to me here in Tiflis there hardly can be any doubt that the Turks systematically are aiming at the extermination of the few hundred thousand Armenians whom they left alive until now 

Similarly, Major General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein noted that ""The Turkish policy of causing starvation is an all too obvious proof... for the Turkish resolve to destroy the Armenians.""Another notable figure in the German military camp was Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter, who documented various massacres of Armenians. He sent fifteen reports regarding ""deportations and mass killings"" to Germany's chancellor in Berlin. His final report noted that fewer than 100,000 Armenians were left alive in the Ottoman Empire; the rest had been exterminated (German: ausgerottet). Scheubner-Richter also detailed the methods of the Ottoman government, noting its use of the Special Organization and other bureaucratized instruments of genocide. 

Some Germans openly supported the Ottoman policy against the Armenians. As Hans Humann, the German naval attaché in Constantinople said to U.S. Ambassador Henry Morgenthau: 

I have lived in Turkey the larger part of my life ... and I know the Armenians. I also know that both Armenians and Turks cannot live together in this country. One of these races has got to go. And I don't blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians. I think that they are entirely justified. The weaker nation must succumb. The Armenians desire to dismember Turkey; they are against the Turks and the Germans in this war, and they therefore have no right to exist here. 

                                                                                                            – Hans Humann, Ambassador Morgenthau's Story 

In a genocide conference in 2001, professor Wolfgang Wipperman of the Free University of Berlin introduced documents evidencing that the German High Command was aware of the mass killings at the time but chose not to interfere or speak out. 

Russian military 

The Russian Empire's response to the bombardment of its Black Sea naval ports was primarily a land campaign through the Caucasus. Early victories against the Ottoman Empire from the winter of 1914 to the spring 1915 saw significant gains of territory, including relieving the Armenian bastion resisting in the city of Van in May 1915. The Russians also reported encountering the bodies of unarmed civilian Armenians in the areas they advanced through.In March 1916, the scenes they saw in the city of Erzerum led the Russians to retaliate against the Ottoman III Army whom they held responsible for the massacres, destroying it in its entirety. 

Swedish Embassy and Military Attaché 

Sweden, as a neutral state during the entire World War I, had permanent representatives in the Ottoman Empire, able to continiously report on the ongoing events in the country. The Swedish Embassy in Constantinople, represented by Ambassador Per Gustaf August Cosswa Anckarsvärd, along with Envoy M. Ahlgren, and the Swedish Military Attaché, Captain Einar af Wirsén, closely followed the development throughout the empire, reporting, among others, on the Armenian massacres. On July 7, 1915, Anckarsvärd dispatched a two page report to Stockholm, beginning with the following information: 

The persecutions of the Armenians have reached hair-raising proportions and all points to the fact that the Young Turks want to seize the opportunity, since due to different reasons there are no effective external pressure to be feared, to once and for all put an end to the Armenian question. The means for this are quite simple and consist of the extermination (utrotandet) of the Armenian nation. 
During the remaining of 1915 alone, Anckarsvärd dispatched six other reports entitled ""The Persecutions of the Armenians"". In his report on July 22, Anckarsvärd noted that the persecutions of the Armenians were being extended to encompass all Christians in the Ottoman Empire. Quoting the statement of the Greek chargé d'affaires: 

the deportations can not be any other issue than an annihilation war against the Greek nation in Turkey and as measures hereof they have been implementing forced conversions to Islam, in obvious aim to, that if after the end of the war there again would be a question of European intervention for the protection of the Christians, there will be as few of them left as possible. 

On August 9, 1915, Anckarsvärd dispatched yet another report, confirming his suspicions regarding the plans of the Turkish Government: 

It is obvious that the Turks are taking the opportunity to, now during the war, annihilate [utplåna] the Armenian nation so that when the peace comes no Armenian question longer exists."" 

When reflecting upon the situation in Turkey during the final stages of the war, Envoy Alhgren presented an analysis of the prevailing situation in Turkey and the hard times which had befallen the population. In explaining the increased living costs he identified a number of reasons: ""obstacles for domestic trade, the almost total paralysing of the foreign trade and finally the strong decreasing of labour power, caused partly by the mobilisation but partly also by the extermination of the Armenian race [utrotandet af den armeniska rasen]."" 

Wirsén, when writing his memoirs from his mission to the Balkans and Turkey, Minnen från fred och krig (“Memories from Peace and War”), dedicated an entire chapter to the Armenian genocide, entitled Mordet på en nation (“The Murder of a Nation”). Commenting the deportations as a result of accusing the Armenians for collaboration with the Russians, Wirsén concludes that the subsequent deportations were nothing but a cover for the extermination: ""Officially, these had the goal to move the entire Armenian population to the steppe regions of Northern Mesopotamia and Syria, but in reality they aimed to exterminate [utrota] the Armenians, whereby the pure Turkish element in Asia Minor would achieve a dominating position."" 

In conclusion, Wirsén made the following note: ""The annihilation of the Armenian nation in Asia Minor must revolt all human feelings...The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair-raising. I can still see in front of me Talaat’s cynical expression, when he emphasized that the Armenian question was solved."" 

Aftermath 

Turkish courts-martial 
Main article: Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919-20 
In 1919, Sultan Mehmed VI ordered domestic courts-martial to try members of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) (Turkish: ""Ittihat Terakki"") for their role in taking the Ottoman Empire into World War I. The courts-martial blamed the members of CUP for pursuing a war that did not fit into the notion of Millet. The Armenian issue was used as a tool to punish the leaders of the CUP. Most of the documents generated in these courts were later moved to international trials. By January 1919, a report to Sultan Mehmed VI accused over 130 suspects, most of whom were high officials. The military court found that it was the will of the CUP to eliminate the Armenians physically, via its special organization. The 1919 pronouncement reads as follows: 

The Court Martial taking into consideration the above-named crimes declares, unanimously, the culpability as principal factors of these crimes the fugitives Talat Pasha, former Grand Vizir, Enver Efendi, former War Minister, struck off the register of the Imperial Army, Cemal Efendi, former Navy Minister, struck off too from the Imperial Army, and Dr. Nazim Efendi, former Minister of Education, members of the General Council of the Union & Progress, representing the moral person of that party;... the Court Martial pronounces, in accordance with said stipulations of the Law the death penalty against Talat, Enver, Cemal, and Dr. Nazim. 

The term Three Pashas, which include Mehmed Talat Pasha and Ismail Enver, refers to the triumvirate who had fled the Empire at the end of World War I. At the trials in Constantinople in 1919 they were sentenced to death in absentia. The courts-martial officially disbanded the CUP and confiscated its assets, and the assets of those found guilty. At least two of the three were later assassinated by Armenian vigilantes. 

International trials 

Following the Mudros Armistice, the preliminary Peace Conference in Paris established ""The Commission on Responsibilities and Sanctions"" in January 1919, which was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Lansing. Based on the commission's work, several articles were added to the Treaty of Sèvres, and the acting government of the Ottoman Empire, Sultan Mehmed VI and Damat Adil Ferit Pasha, were summoned to trial. The Treaty of Sèvres (August 1920) planned a trial to determine those responsible for the ""barbarous and illegitimate methods of warfare... [including] offenses against the laws and customs of war and the principles of humanity"". Article 230 of the Treaty of Sèvres required the Ottoman Empire ""hand over to the Allied Powers the persons whose surrender may be required by the latter as being responsible for the massacres committed during the continuance of the state of war on territory which formed part of the Ottoman Empire on August 1, 1914."" 

Various Ottoman politicians, generals, and intellectuals were transferred to Malta, where they were held for some three years while searches were made of archives in Constantinople, London, Paris and Washington to investigate their actions.However, the Inter-allied tribunal attempt demanded by the Treaty of Sèvres never solidified and the detainees were eventually returned to Turkey in exchange for British citizens held by Kemalist Turkey. 

Trial of Soghomon Tehlirian 

Grand Vizier Talat Pasha who was assassinated by Soghomon TehlirianOn March 15, 1921, former Grand Vizier Talat Pasha was assassinated in the Charlottenburg District of Berlin, Germany, in broad daylight and in the presence of many witnesses. Talat's death was part of ""Operation Nemesis"", the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's codename for their covert operation in the 1920s to kill the planners of the Armenian Genocide. 

The subsequent trial of the assassin, Soghomon Tehlirian, had an important influence on Raphael Lemkin, a lawyer of Polish-Jewish descent who campaigned in the League of Nations to ban what he called ""barbarity"" and ""vandalism"", and, in 1943, coined the word genocide. 

Armenian deaths, 1914 to 1918 

While there is no consensus as to how many Armenians lost their lives during the Armenian Genocide, there is general agreement among western scholars that over 500,000 Armenians died between 1914 and 1918. Estimates vary between 300,000 (per the modern Turkish state) to 1,500,000 (per modern Armenia, Argentina,and other states). Encyclopædia Britannica references the research of Arnold J. Toynbee, an intelligence officer of the British Foreign Office, who estimated that 600,000 Armenians ""died or were massacred during deportation"" in the years 1915–1916. 

Memorials 

Over 135 memorials, spread across 25 countries, commemorate the Armenian Genocide. 

In 1965, the 50th anniversary of the genocide, a 24-hour mass protest was initiated in Yerevan emanding recognition of the Armenian Genocide by Soviet authorities. The memorial was completed two years later, at Tsitsernakaberd above the Hrazdan gorge in Yerevan. The 44 metres (140 ft) stele symbolizes the national rebirth of Armenians. Twelve slabs are positioned in a circle, representing 12 lost provinces in present day Turkey. At the center of the circle there is an eternal flame. Each April 24, hundreds of thousands of people walk to the genocide monument and lay flowers around the eternal flame. 

Another memorial, at Alfortville, Paris, was bombed on May 3, 1984, by a hit-team headed by Grey Wolves member Abdullah Catli and paid by the Turkish intelligence agency (MİT)

The men inside, with someone unconscious and unable to wake up, supposedly perform a body cavity search, supposedly one area of the uterus is shadowed by the pelvic bone and is not always clear on x rays when using magnetic resonance imagery? 
What might the men be looking for that could be so desperately urgent ? What are some examples (besides drugs) of something the males might find inside of the vaginal cavity of a woman ? What were they supposed to do if they found something ? Since the attacks of 9/11/2001 and the introduction of NT terror legislation called the USA PATRIOT ACT, The Act is believed to allow the FBI/FBIPD to make triple overtime when there is a suspected terrorist in the area. One possible problem is that with triple overtime, how is a person supposed to ever prove her/his innocence ? If the person was to go back to not being a suspected terrorist, the salaries would return to normal ? Because the USA Patriot Act provides Law Enforcement with ""Special Tools(and) Abilities"" to counter any type of ""Terrorist Type Activity"" that might be encountered, it is also very easy to turn into a one sided unlimited offensive weapon with only one dishonest person ( terrorist employed as Police Officer and or FBI duty agent?) to almost take over the country ( behind the scenes control of the Office of the President ? ) and secretly terrorize the People of the United States of America by using taxpayer money to bank roll ( counter ) acts of terrorism, that may not have originally happened ? One sided Lies (osl) turns the Patriot Act into an uncontestable and unknown of unlimited offensive weapon, with only one person being dishonest. I know because I've been a victim of terrorism for 10 years in San Francisco, California. The fbi here participate in and/or allows what would normally be considered acts of terrorism, they also discredit people without the victims knowing it, and fabricate a false psychiatric history, change your dental records, replace, alter or remove your medical history, install a tiny microphone that has the ability to transmit information from inside of your neck to the persons left of their Addams Apple, approximately, and can record your normal speaking in everyday conversations and eventually collect enough of your common vocabulary to have experts separate each word ( it's probably edited almost as it is recorded) ( if it's someone's voice they want to use ) the clear recorded individual words are then loaded into another computer program so they can be triggered externally as another person speaks what the recorded voice taking the place of the actual person speaking, for example calling your wife or your husband and speaking to them as if they were you, or calling a friend and insulting them ? Hints of infidelity in the speech could cause a wife to cheat ? The use of electronics, computer hacking, remote monitoring and hidden camera masturbation, locksmithing, alarm defeating, nightly unknown of trespassing, burglaries occurring nightly- sometimes twice- once in the night during sleep and once during the day while the victim is away. Myself as a victim nicknamed one type of activity a ""Charged Particle Atmosphere"" 
The use of strands of ions as flowing energy ( research operational theory of: ionic breeze by the sharper image company catalog showrooms), caused with flows of ions ( created by electrons traveling towards protons ( the attraction from a positively coated surface) causes a ""breeze of energy"" without using any moving parts, and might also be noticed as a mist, with the mist actually bring some type of chemical ( it couldn't be radon or argon could it ? those are radioactive gasses and are both expected to be semiconductors), that cause some type of drugging effect ? 
Also common use of a (rat?) poison that causes a hard boiled egg taste in the burp thar is horribly foul before during and after vomiting, and remains very painful, sometimes the sickness might last for a day, sometimes maybe more, the foul hard boiled egg burping taste taking a few days to get rid of, I know because I was sick last week and had to go to the emergency room at the hospital recently and I'm sick with it again today from eating two butterfingers ( that somebody replaced without my knowledge) that had a slightly soaked in sea water taste? a little bit like an aquarium smells ? 
Previously I've had to go to the hospital 6 times in a row in an ambulance. This has caused me to run up a hospital bill of maybe fifteen thousand dollars, myself unemployed and next in line to inherit the family home from my mother who recently you came the only owner when my father became the victim of a natural causes death that:s actually a homicide in disguise. the nightly exposure to energy that starts each night after a victim is asleep, and turns off before the victim is awake. it's believed to be called cycling energy. CE ? And is believed to eventually cause internal organ failure, that is actually a homicide disguised as a natural causes death. It also seems hinted of within the name ""Cold War"" ? cold changed to 
3old = PI•E ? Compare each as an inverted copy of the other, upside down backwards? 
compare again: 
C is the third letter of the English alphabet, so alphanumerically the C is replaced with the number 3. This changes the word '""cold"" to ""3old"" ? The abbreviated formula (to find the amount of electrical power in a circuit) is shown without quotation marks as 
""P = I x E"" or abbreviated even shorter as 
""PI•E"". 3old = PI•E ? 
What this means : 
When a victim is exposed to harmful amounts of energy while asleep, one of the types of exposure might be from something called wattage, also called watts, named after the person who discovered it. it is a measurement of something called Power. Power measured as watts, is what cooks food in a microwave oven, it's also the energy that comes from a radio stations antenna. the formula for determining the amount of power is simple. To determine the amount of Power, multiply Amperes x Volts. 
The simple way to remember the formula is the word ""PIE"". 
The letter X can be replaced with a large dot shown here • that is the symbol for multiplication. 
The symbol for electrical Power is abbreviated with upper case letter P. 
Of the many ways it can be written ( abbreviated ) here's two of them. 
Translated: 
""Power is equal to Amperes multiplied with Volts"" 
abbreviated: 
""P = I × E"" 
The same thing abbreviated with a multiplication dot: 
""PI•E"" 
Power ( equals ) Amperes Dot Volts. 
In scientific notation the symbol for amperes is the uppercase letter I the symbol for Volts is the uppercase letter E. 
The word ""cold"" of ""Cold War"" might have more hidden within it than a way of making thousands of strategic kills since 1949 and us here in the United States just thinking people died from internal organ failures, labeled as natural causes deaths ? 
Without a homicide that was caused by energy ever being known of, no alarm was ever sounded, no warnings were issued, no safety measures were taken. An enemy might have picked out every single person they wanted to kill and then replace with their own people or a look alike or resemblance of the person using the person's actual identification itself. Thus identity theft was born. This is something I call theory of the Dead Agent (CIA= 3old ) CIA = CnIIA = cold = hId ? h+I+d=R+4=22=V ? hIdV ?

""This Shall Be The Story Of The Fall Of A Human Soul— A Fall Which Is Great."" 

Colonel James S. Ketchum dreamed of war without killing. He joined the Army in 1956 and left it in 1976, and in that time he did not fight in Vietnam; he did not invade the Bay of Pigs; he did not guard Western Europe with tanks, or help build nuclear launch sites beneath the Arctic ice. Instead, he became the military’s leading expert in a secret Cold War experiment: to fight enemies with clouds of psychochemicals that temporarily incapacitate the mind—causing, in the words of one ranking officer, a “selective malfunctioning of the human machine.” 

For nearly a decade, Ketchum, a psychiatrist, went about his work in the belief that chemicals are more humane instruments of warfare than bullets and shrapnel—or, at least, he told himself such things. To achieve his dream, he worked tirelessly at a secluded Army research facility, testing chemical weapons on hundreds of healthy soldiers, and thinking all along that he was doing good 

Within the Army, and in the world of medical research, the secret clinical trials are a faint memory. But for some of the surviving test subjects, and for the doctors who tested them, what happened at Edgewood remains deeply unresolved. Were the human experiments there a Dachau-like horror, or were they sound and necessary science? As veterans of the tests have come forward, their unanswered questions have slowly gathered into a kind of historical undertow, and Ketchum, more than anyone else, has been caught in its pull. In 2006, he self-published a memoir, “Chemical Warfare: Secrets Almost Forgotten,” which defended the research. Next year, a class-action lawsuit brought against the federal government by former test subjects will go to trial, and Ketchum is expected to be the star witness. 

The drugs under review ranged from tear gas and LSD to highly lethal nerve agents, like VX, a substance developed at Edgewood. Ketchum’s specialty was a family of molecules that block a key neurotransmitter, causing delirium. The drugs were known mainly by Army codes, with their true formulas classified. The soldiers were never told what they were given, or what the specific effects might be, and the Army made no effort to track how they did afterward. Edgewood’s most extreme critics raise the spectre of mass injury—a hidden American tragedy. 

Ketchum, an unreconstructed advocate of chemical warfare, believes that people who fear gaseous weapons more than guns and mortars are irrational. He cites approvingly the Russian government’s decision, in 2002, to flood a theatre in Moscow with a potent incapacitating drug when Chechen guerrillas seized the building and took eight hundred theatregoers hostage. The gas debilitated the hostage takers, allowing special forces to sweep in and kill them. But many innocent people died, too. “It’s been looked at by some skeptics as a kind of tragedy,” Ketchum has said. “They say, ‘Look, a hundred and thirty people died.’ Well, I think that a hundred and thirty is better than eight hundred, and it’s also better, as a secondary consideration, not to have to blow up a beautiful theatre.” 

Edgewood had been built in a fit of urgency during the First World War, when weaponized gas—chlorine and, later, mustard—was used to devastating effect in the trenches of Europe. Fritz Haber, the German scientist who pioneered the rise of chemical weapons, proclaimed, “In no future war will the military be able to ignore poison gas. It is a higher form of killing.” The U.S. Army took the threat seriously, and launched a program to study the chemicals, building laboratories and gas chambers in order to test human subjects. “We began to hear about the terrors of this place,” a private wrote in 1918. “Everyone we talked to on the way out here said we were coming to the place God forgot! They tell tales about men being gassed and burned.” 

After the Second World War, intelligence reports emerged from Germany of chemical weapons far deadlier than mustard or chlorine. The new compounds, which had evolved out of research into insecticides, were called nerve gases, because they created a body-wide overflow of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, often triggering organ failure and near-sudden death. The Reich had invested primarily in three—tabun, soman, and sarin—and the victorious powers rushed to obtain them. The Soviet Union secretly dismantled an entire nerve-gas plant and relocated the technology behind the Iron Curtain. The American government, for its part, acquired the Nazi chemical formulas—and, in some cases, the scientists who developed them—and brought them to Edgewood. 

The Army decided to pursue sarin. The chemical was about twenty-five times as deadly as cyanide, and readily made into an aerosol. It was virtually impossible to handle without casualties; in one year, seven technicians required immediate treatment following accidental exposure. As the vapor was released after tests, birds passing over the flue of the gas chambers fell dead, and had to be cleared off the roof. In experiments that the arsenal contracted at Johns Hopkins University, researchers gave sarin to healthy volunteers in cups of water over three days. Some of the subjects were severely poisoned; they twitched, vomited, and had trouble breathing. 

Early nerve-gas experiments focussed on the extreme lethality of the chemicals, and on antidotes, but researchers at Edgewood also began to take note of the chemicals’ cognitive side effects. Subjects often felt giddy at first, then deeply anxious. Some had nightmares or lost sleep and became depressed. A secret 1948 study on the poisoned Edgewood technicians noted that “the outstanding feature of these cases appears to be the psychological reactions,” and its author wondered how “young men having no experience or knowledge” of the chemicals would react. A senior official at the arsenal had observed that men exposed to highly diluted tabun “were partially disabled for from one to three weeks with fatigue, lassitude, complete loss of initiative and interest, and apathy.” 

I spoke to a former Edgewood test subject who was given the nerve agent VX, which, when applied to the skin, is a hundred times as deadly as sarin. An officer came to his bedside to draw a small circle on his arm, and then a doctor with a syringe squirted on a drop of liquid. The effect was rapid. The subject heard other people groaning—one man said, “Oh, shit”—but he felt only a calm disassociation from his environment. There was a radio on in the room, but the words made little sense. When he was given food, he didn’t know what to do with his utensils. “I was not in control,” he told me. “It was incredible. This tiny drop had rendered me helpless.” As the test continued, he was seized by an agonizing wave of tension, as if each nerve ending were being crushed in a vise. “It was intense,” he told me. “My body was clenched. All of my nerves were tight, physically and mentally.” 

In 1949, L. Wilson Greene, Edge wood’s scientific director, typed up a classified report, “Psychochemical Warfare: A New Concept of War,” that called for a search for compounds that would create the same debilitating mental side effects as nerve gas, but without the lethality. “Throughout recorded history, wars have been characterized by death, human misery, and the destruction of property; each major conflict being more catastrophic than the one preceding it,” Greene argued. “I am convinced that it is possible, by means of the techniques of psychochemical warfare, to conquer an enemy without the wholesale killing of his people or the mass destruction of his property.” 

In its broad strokes, “Psychochemical Warfare” fit within the evolving ethos at Edgewood: better fighting through chemistry. The first commanding general of the Army’s Chemical Warfare Service had extolled the “effectiveness and humaneness” of gases: they killed quickly, and kept infrastructure intact. Psychochemical warfare certainly promised a form of conflict less deadly than clouds of sarin—even more humane, in that sense, perhaps. But Greene did not want to elevate consciousness; he wanted to debilitate, in ways that would inspire terror. As he put it, “The symptoms which are considered to be of value in strategic and tactical operations include the following: fits or seizures, dizziness, fear, panic, hysteria, hallucinations, migraine, delirium, extreme depression, notions of hopelessness, lack of initiative to do even simple things, suicidal mania.” 

Greene drew up a list of chemicals to investigate, ranging from barbiturates to carbon monoxide, and he urged a deeper inquiry into the psychological effects of nerve gas. Enoch Callaway, a Navy psychiatrist who arrived at Edgewood in 1950, recalled, “I was told that I needed to measure ‘nervousness,’ because nerve gas was supposed to make you nervous.” So he designed a test: people given sarin were blasted with noise to measure how much they jumped. “We figured out that nerve gas actually reduced anxiety in doses that did not cause convulsions.” The work, he insisted, was conducted responsibly, with a sense of urgency now hard to understand: “We didn’t know that chemical warfare was going to disappear so thoroughly.” 

In the mid-nineteen-fifties, psychochemical warfare was formally added to Edgewood’s clinical research, and approval was granted to recruit soldiers from around the country for the experiments, in a systematic effort called the Medical Research Volunteer Program. The Army assured Congress that the chemicals were “perfectly safe” and offered “a new vista of controlling people without any deaths”—even though early efforts to make weapons from mescaline and LSD were dropped, because the drugs were too unsafe or too unpredictable. Congressional overseers, terrified of Soviet military superiority, were ready to lend support. The Red Army had an extensive chemical-warfare program, and evidence suggested that it had an interest in “psychic poisons,” used to trigger mental illness. “Some foreign enemy could already be subjecting us in the United States to such things,” one panicky legislator proclaimed during a hearing. “Are we the ones receiving it now? Are we the rabbits and guinea pigs?” 

Edgewood began reviewing hundreds of chemicals, many provided by pharmaceutical companies. One officer remarked, “The characteristics we are looking for in these agents are in general exactly opposite to what the pharmaceutical firms want in drugs, that is the undesirable side effects.” Starting in 1959, the arsenal aggressively pursued phencyclidine—or PCP—which Parke, Davis &amp; Company had marketed as an anesthetic but abandoned because patients were having hallucinations and delusions. Edgewood doctors tested it as an aerosol and surreptitiously gave it to soldiers to see if they could then “maintain physical security over simulated classified material.” One subject—who had been exposed to sarin gas a week earlier—was handed a glass of whiskey laced with twenty milligrams of PCP. “Manic reaction and much hostility,” a doctor observed. The subject passed out, and began breathing in a pattern associated with neurological trauma or cardiac stress. 

Rioch told Ketchum that another volunteer had ended up in the hospital for six weeks. “He had a paranoid reaction that didn’t go away after the drug wore off,” Ketchum recalled. The trials with PCP were eventually dropped, but stories of other problem cases circulated. A military advisory council decided that the arsenal was ill equipped for the newer line of research. “It seems important to undertake immediately a program to develop sound, fundamental techniques of assessing abnormal behavior,” its members noted. “The services of people trained in this field, such as psychologists, psychiatrists and neuro-physiologists should be obtained.” Edgewood, in other words, needed young doctors just like Jim Ketchum. 

The psychochemical-warfare program was a small part of the over-all research, and in many respects it was the strangest. Once, Ketchum walked into his office and found a barrel the size of an oil drum standing in a corner. No one explained why it was in his office, or who had put it there. After a couple of days, he waited until evening and opened it. Inside, he found dozens of small glass vials, each containing a precisely measured amount of pure LSD; he figured there was enough to make several hundred million people go bonkers—and later calculated the street value of the barrel to be roughly a billion dollars. At the end of the week, the barrel vanished just as mysteriously as it had appeared. No one spoke about it. He never learned what it was for. 

After receiving a security clearance, Ketchum was told that EA 2277 was 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, or BZ—a pharmaceutical, intended as an ulcer therapy, that was rejected after tests found it unsuitable. Infinitesimal amounts could send people into total mental disorder. BZ is an anticholinergic, similar to atropine or scopolamine, which are used in medicine today. At high doses, such drugs trigger delirium—a dreamlike insanity usually forgotten after it subsides. Sim, one of the first doctors to try BZ, later proclaimed that it “zonked” him for three days. “I kept falling down,” he said. “The people at the lab assigned someone to follow me around with a mattress.” 

For years, Sim had been overseeing secret intelligence experiments at Edgewood. At one point, he did research for the C.I.A. on a BZ-type drug, called the Boomer, that causes delirium for as long as two weeks. The agency wanted to know if it could be administered through the skin. Could a Soviet agent brush some on silverware at a diplomatic party and cause an American official to go crazy? Could an operative dose an adversary with a handshake? Sim initiated trials at the arsenal and at Holmesburg Prison, in Pennsylvania, with which Edgewood had contracted to conduct experiments on inmates. 

Testing psychochemicals for intelligence purposes, Sim appeared to believe, required a uniquely loose protocol: the goal was to control the mind, and the subject’s expectations of the drug’s effect mattered. He often gave LSD to people without warning. 

Not long after arriving at Edgewood, Ketchum took to playing tennis with a commanding officer at the arsenal, who, after a match one day, described how Sim had spiked his morning coffee with LSD. “He was pissed off as hell,” Ketchum told me. LSD had been mixed into cocktails at a party, and into an Army unit’s water supply. Some men handled it fine; some went berserk. A test subject in 1957 exhibited “euphoria followed by severe depression, anxiety, and panic—feeling he was going to die,” according to his chart. Another test involved intelligence specialists who were blindfolded and placed in an isolation chamber. “Only one subject was in a condition to undergo extended interrogation,” a report concluded. “A second subject fled from interrogation in panic.” 

Ketchum later wrote of Sim’s “hare-brained experiments” and his “lack of scientific (and ethical) judgment.” The Army had apparently reached the same conclusion. In 1959, responsibility for the volunteers was taken from Sim—who was eventually given the new title of chief scientist—and transferred to Lindsey, a more capable leader, though not immune to bouts of recklessness himself. To demonstrate the effects of VX, he was known to dip his finger in a beaker containing the lethal agent, then rub it on the back of a shaved rabbit; as the animal convulsed and died, he would casually walk across the room and bathe his finger in a Martini to wash off the VX. “I thought they were crazy,” a doctor who served under him told me. “I was going to New York, and Colonel Lindsey tells me, ‘How about taking a vial of nerve gas to New York to make a demonstration.’ And I am looking at the guy and thinking, If I have an accident on the Thruway, I could kill thousands of people—thousands of people. I said, ‘No. It’s that simple.’ ” 

Sim appeared to believe that personally sampling every chemical agent made him free to circumvent conventional standards; “I have to live with myself,” he once said. Lindsey had an officer’s protectiveness for the enlisted men. Many of the Army doctors—draftees, like the volunteers—who worked under both men strove to reconcile their military obligations with their medical commitments. “As doctors, we are used to treating people who are sick, not making them sick,” one told me. “I did not like the idea of what I was doing with individual human beings. But I understood what I was doing in the context of the defense of this country.” 

Exposed soldiers exhibited bizarre symptoms: rapid mumbling, or picking obsessively at bedclothes and other objects, real or imaginary. “Subjects sometimes display something approaching wit, not in the form of word-play, but as a kind of sarcasm or unexpected frankness,” he wrote in a report for Sim. The drug’s effect lasted for days. At its peak, volunteers were totally cut off in their own minds, jolting from one fragmented existence to the next. They saw visions: Lilliputian baseball players competing on a tabletop diamond; animals or people or objects that materialized and vanished. “I had a great urge to smoke and, when I thought about it, a lit cigarette appeared in my hand,” a volunteer given a drug similar to BZ recalled shortly after the experiment. “I could actually smoke the cigarette.” 

Soldiers on BZ could remember only fragments of the experience afterward. As the drug wore off, and the subjects had trouble discerning what was real, many experienced anxiety, aggression, even terror. Ketchum built padded cells to prevent injuries, but at times the subjects couldn’t be contained. One escaped, running from imagined murderers. Another, on a drug similar to BZ, saw “bugs, worms, one snake, a monkey and numerous rats,” and thought his skin was covered in blood. “Subject broke a wooden chair and smashed a hole in the wall after tearing down a 4-by-7-ft panel of padding,” his chart noted. Ketchum and three assistants piled on top of the soldier to subdue him. “He was clearly terrified and convinced we were intending to kill him,” his chart said. 

“These soldiers are not really informed at all,” he told Malcolm Bowers, an Edgewood medical officer who later became a professor at Yale. Little was known about the long-term effects of the experiments, and yet the volunteers, after a stay at the arsenal, were blindly pushed back into the Army at large, with no follow-up care. In a self-published memoir, “Men and Poisons,” Bowers recalls Lindsey wondering if the lack of follow-up stemmed from the Army’s fear that such a program would disclose concern about lasting health effects. Sim later offered a more mundane reason: insufficient funding 

The Medical Research Volunteer Program initially had difficulty attracting volunteers, so monthly quotas were established to insure a steady supply of research subjects. Recruiters fanned out to Army facilities across the country; some commanders even ordered men to attend the sessions. People who attended the sessions came away with an uncertain sense of what they were being asked to do. 

A number of them told me that recruiters advertised the program in vague terms, as human behavioral studies, or equipment testing, or medical research. Inducements were offered, too. Soldiers could spend time near several large East Coast cities, and would be given three-day weekend passes to explore them. There would be extra pay, and few responsibilities, aside from showing up at a test. Many men spent much of their stay playing Ping-Pong and watching movies. When it came time for volunteers to leave—at first, they were asked to serve for a month, later two months—a letter of commendation would enter their file. In the sixties, the arsenal offered an even more powerful incentive: time away from Vietnam. 

Once the volunteers arrived at Edgewood, they were given medical and psychological examinations, and were divided into four groups. The least healthy would be used to test equipment. The top twenty-five per cent—the Astronaut Class, as Ketchum once called them—would typically be prepared for the most dangerous chemicals. Doctors informed the volunteers in generalities and asked them to sign a consent form—usually long before any specific test was announced. The forms were designed to offer few details; as one version was drafted, the words “mental disturbance or unconsciousness” were replaced with “discomfiture.” Sometimes a little more information would be provided just before the test began, but not always. Van Sim later confessed that researchers testing nerve gas would tell volunteers that the drug might give them a “runny nose” or a “slight tightness of the chest.” In 1961, a volunteer from Kansas, named John Ross, was given soman, a highly persistent nerve agent. Only when the needle was in his arm did he overhear the doctors saying that he had been given something lethal. “I started having convulsions,” he told me. “I started vomiting. One of the guys standing over me said, ‘We gave you a little too much.’ They told me to walk it off. I started to panic. I thought I was going to die.” Ross became rigid and was rushed to Walter Reed. For years afterward, he suffered from insomnia and depression. 

Test subjects had a right to decline an experiment—assuming that they knew they were part of one—but they almost never did. “There was no question that they would participate,” Bowers recalled. Withdrawing from a test required backing down from a commitment to one’s superior, which was anathema in the Army. “In the military, if you don’t do something you will be ostracized,” a soldier given LSD in 1958 told me. “I believe they did give us the option to leave, at first, but you didn’t really have a choice once you were in.” 

The same day Elbin was given BZ, Ketchum gave the drug to Teddie Osborne, who had been stationed at the Yuma Test Center, in Arizona, where he was using a crude detector and a caged rabbit to look for chemical leaks. Osborne thought that his work would not change much at Edgewood. “It wasn’t really explained,” he told me. At the arsenal, he was assigned to help manage the recruits; he liked the work and volunteered again. 

The second time, he was told that he was going to be a subject. He felt tricked. “I could not have said no,” he told me. “You are dealing with professionals. We were very gullible.” One Wednesday, Osborne was injected with BZ, and ushered into a padded room. He had no idea what the drug was or what it would do. “I don’t remember anything until Saturday,” he told me. “That was so disturbing. Later, it still haunted me.” 

By this time, the Army was running a “crash program” to turn BZ into an operational weapon. 

Even as it became reasonable to suspect that BZ could cause serious injury on the battlefield, the military was pushing to put it into use. In November, 1964, an Army major travelled to Edgewood on an urgent mission from Lieutenant General William Dick, the chief of Army research. Soviet trawlers had been spotted off the coast of Alaska, and Dick wanted to know if a projected cloud of BZ could disable the crew. Senior officers at the arsenal told the major that such a thing was out of the question—the chemical had not even been field-tested. Eventually, the major came to see Ketchum, who was leading a newly created group called the Psychopharmacology Branch. “The plan didn’t make a whole lot of sense, and it offended me on a rational level,” he wrote in his memoir. “On the other hand, the challenge ruthlessly tickled my imagination. 

The Soviets were not ignorant of BZ, after all. Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who conducted secret weapons research for the Soviet Union, told me that Moscow never had more than a halfhearted interest in LSD, and that its interest in BZ was strictly to keep up with Ketchum’s program. “We knew the West had developed this weapon, and we were trying to copy it,” he said. Soviet scientists, who called the formula Substance 78, conducted their own clinical trials with it and manufactured tons of the drug at a plant in Volsk. 

By the late sixties, the high point of the Cold War had sloped into a murkier geopolitical condition; half a million Americans were in Vietnam, and though the Army had freely used defoliants and tear gas there, it decided not to use BZ. Popular sentiment was turning against the idea of deploying psychochemicals in war. “There are moral imponderables, such as whether insanity, temporary or permanent, is a more ‘humane’ military threat than the usual afflictions of war,” E. James Lieberman, a psychiatric resident at Harvard, wrote in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. In 1965, Sidney Cohen, a well-regarded LSD researcher, argued that “such degradation of a person’s mind is worse than his physical death and can hardly be considered humane warfare.” 

A physician named Mark Needle told me that he thought Ketchum’s human experiments were run like the Keystone Kops. “There was nobody qualified,” he said. “And the fact that they were allowed to do it without people who knew what they were doing was very, very scary. There was no humanity in it. There was no morality in it. If anything happened to the volunteers, we could say, ‘You were offered an out,’ but then we were also telling them, ‘Listen, this is the Army, and we are at war.’ Our view was that this was a terrible thing to do to these kids, because who the hell knew what could happen?” 

When Ketchum sought to orchestrate a field test with a new version of BZ, four doctors wrote in dissent. He overruled them. Another version, called EA 3834, appeared to cause microscopic hematuria—tiny amounts of blood in urine—and other renal problems. One soldier was sent to Walter Reed. “This is a dangerous drug,” a psychiatrist named George Leib insisted. Leib, who worked on the arsenal’s annual budget, had come to think that tests of a baroque nature and questionable design were being funded merely to sustain the program. His office was across from the toxic-aid station, and he was sure that records were being manipulated to disguise problem cases. 

In April, Matthew Meselson, a Harvard biologist, argued in congressional testimony that non-lethal chemical weapons would only make war more savage, because armies would use them to flush out enemies and then slaughter them. 

The lasting health effects of the research were difficult to judge. Records were either messy or incomplete, and no experiment had collected data to determine how a drug might affect lives in the long term 
. 
The Nuremberg Code established an ethical framework for medical experiments. The code begins with a clear premise: 

“The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.” That consent must flow from an “enlightened decision,” shaped by a true understanding of the test’s medical risks. Moreover, human experiments must be preceded by animal studies, and conducted in pursuit of a greater social good—with risks never exceeding “the humanitarian importance of the problem.” If a subject is unable to endure the experiment, or if a researcher believes there is a probability of injury, the test must end.

Why do we need Sodium Ascorbate? 

The GLO Gene is absent in many people. Scientists believe that this happened around 60 million years ago. The absence of this gene makes us unable to biosynthesize the specific enzyme L- gulonolactone oxidase. This is an end-stage liver enzyme that bio-converts blood glucose to Ascorbate; without it, our bodies cannot produce any Ascorbate.  In the long term, the lack of Ascorbate causes our bones to dissolve and teeth to fall out; in other words, sub-clinical scurvy and a tendency to develop cancer. 

Ascorbic Acid is produced in large quantities in almost all animals, e.g. 6 grams a day in goat, or up to 100grams daily if the goat is stressed. But it is not the Ascorbic Acid our body requires, rather a SALT of Ascorbic Acid. A daily supplementation of Ascorbate several times a day is a simple way to make up for this genetic defect.﻿

Has anyone else watched this for, oh, say, 100 times? It's one of the ultimate movies for geeks. Pure joy with this film! 

""Shall We Play a Game?"" 

WarGames is a 1983 American Cold War science-fiction film written by Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes and directed by John Badham. The film stars Matthew Broderick, Dabney Coleman, John Wood, and Ally Sheedy. 

The film follows David Lightman (Broderick), a young hacker who unwittingly accesses WOPR, a United States military supercomputer programmed to predict possible outcomes of nuclear war. Lightman gets WOPR to run a nuclear war simulation, originally believing it to be a computer game. The simulation causes a national nuclear missile scare and nearly starts World War III.

FW14-e122-7307-07	"In the early 1900s, Yellowstone's administration declared war on wolves and coyotes. In addition to shooting and trapping, officials resorted to biological warfare and introduced into Yellowstone a parasitic mite that causes mange. Mange leads to fur loss and that can lead to a slow and painful death due to the ravages of winter. 

The coyote pictured here has mange--is another victim of that introduction a century ago. Mary and I met him as we skied the Blacktail Deer Plateau road. The groomed surface is perfect for cross country skiers or for a coyote with mange that wants to travel without getting snowy and cold. 

The coyote was coming towards us and saw us, but made no move to avoid us. To give him room, Mary and I stepped off the road and sunk into knee-deep snow. The coyote, head down, padded by. Its tail devoid of fur looked like a rat's tail. Its rear legs were streaked with blood from incessant scratching. Mary and I stood silent, our breath billowing in the cold, almost feeling the coyote's pain. 

My new best-selling book has two chapters about coyotes--one recounts how these intelligent little survivors won the war against them. To ""Look Inside"" or buy the book:

FW14-e122-7307-08	"It's been only 70 years since World War II, and the mad scientists from companies like I.G. Farben, BASF, Hoechst, Dow and Bayer, who created the gas chambers and tested dangerous vaccines on innocent Jews, didn't just go away. In fact, they went to work for U.S. corporations and pharmaceutical companies that run the vaccine industry today. At least a dozen of these cold blooded killers were hired fresh out of prison, just 4 to 7 years after the Nuremberg trials found them guilty of mass murder and enslavement. (http://frank.mtsu.edu/~baustin/trials3.html) 

In fact, at the close of WWII, the IG Farben building in Frankfort was protected from allied bombings by the highest levels of military command. Why? IG Farben was the FDA/CDC type of ""pharmaceutical arm"" of Hitler's 4th Reich, and the Rockefellers had a financial interest in maintaining and controlling this pharmaceutical empire, which would soon be catapulted on U.S. soil. Research reveals that Hitler also invested heavily in Merck and other pharmaceutical companies. 

Nazi convicted mass murderers became executives for major U.S. chemical and pharmaceutical companies 

Fritz ter Meer, found guilty of slavery and mass murder at Auschwitz, served only seven years in prison and became Chairman of the Board at Bayer in 1956. Still trust U.S. vaccines? 

Carl Krauch, Executive Member of IG Farben and Head of Military Economics for Hitler, found guilty of slavery and mass murder, served just 6 years in prison, then became Chairman of the Board for BASF in 1952. Still want to get those flu shots? How about that HPV shot for your daughter or son? 

This is the same vaccine industry today which protected and employed Nazi war criminals. The very industry that produced the Nazi gas chambers was purchased by Bayer. So, exactly whom are you trusting with your children's health and welfare? 

Currently, the U.S. Government and the CDC rely solely on the manufacturers of vaccines to report problems, injuries and deaths. This atrocity is like letting murderers be their own judges in court! Where are the checks and balances this country was founded upon? Vaccines have economic and political agendas now, and the FDA does absolutely no testing of their own before making decisions to release vaccines to the masses. 

Want more research before you or your child get injected with a new concocted disease for which there is no cure? Listen to stunning admissions by vaccine industry experts, including Dr. Maurice Hilleman (formerly w/Merck), who admitted to the deadly nature of the most trusted vaccines. (http://www.naturalnews.com/033584_Dr_Maurice_Hilleman_SV40.html) 

Today's vaccines not only contain live versions of the diseases you DO NOT WANT, but also contain GMOs, hormones from infected cows, pigs, chickens and monkeys, untested virus combinations (like H1N1), aluminum, mercury, emulsifiers, and crossbred bacteria from animals, mosquitoes, and diseased humans: 

Measles Live Virus Vaccine: (Attenuvax) Made by Merck. Two injections are given; one at 1 year and another at 4 years old. Contains gelatin, sorbitol, sodium chloride, bovine cow serum, egg protein and human albumin. 

Measles and Mumps Live Virus Vaccine: (M-M-Rvax) Made by Merck. Injected into one year old babies. Contains gelatin, sorbitol, sodium chloride, bovine cow serum, and human albumin. 

Diptheria, Tetanus and Polio Vaccine: Five injections given between 2 and 6 years of age, plus boosters ""recommended"" every 10 years. Contains formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol and aluminum phosphate. 

DTaP, IPV, HBV and Hib*: (Diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B) Given to infants 2 to 12 months with boosters less than a year later. Contains aluminum hydroxide, formaldehyde, and bovine cow serum. 

Gardasil HPV: Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Made by Merck. ""Recommended"" 3 intramuscular injections; given at birth, 2 and 6 months of age. Re-administered to children as young as 9 years of age for a rare sexually transmitted disease. Contains polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, aluminum, and a ""denatured"" (fragmented and weakened) form of the virus. 

Toxic vaccine ingredients and their adverse effects: 

• Bovine cow serum: Extracted from cow skin. When injected causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus; also shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions. 

• Sorbitol: Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues. 

• Gelatin: Derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. Injecting gelatin poses the risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity (mad cow disease). 

• Sodium chloride: Raises blood pressure and inhibits muscle contraction and growth. 

• Egg protein: Vaccines are prepared in eggs (certainly not organic). May contain growth hormones, antibiotics, and salmonella bacteria. 

• Thimerosal: A neurotoxic mercury which causes autism: There are 25 mcg in one average flu vaccine, and the EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms, so children who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple* vaccines receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in one day. 

• Human albumin: The protein portion of blood from pooled human venous plasma; when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, and rapid heart rate. Injecting ""pooled blood"" can result in a loss of body cell mass and cause immunodeficiency virus infection, or contain SV40, AIDS, cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts. 

• Formaldehyde: Highly carcinogenic fluid used to embalm corpses. Ranked one of the most hazardous compounds to human health; can cause liver damage, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive deformation, respiratory distress and cancer. Plus, formaldehyde has been known to fail to deactivate the virus the vaccine is intended to cure, thus enabling a live virus to enter your blood and infect your system. 

• Phenoxyethanol: A glycol ether/chemical; highly toxic to the nervous system, kidneys, and liver. The FDA warns ""can cause shut down of the central nervous system (CNS), vomiting and contact dermatitis"" in cosmetics; imagine when injected into your blood. 

• Aluminum phosphate: Greatly increases toxicity of mercury, so caution about minimum mercury tolerance is therefore severely underestimated. CDC scientists and all doctors are well aware of this. 

• MSG (monosodium glutamate): When injected becomes a neurotoxin, causing CNS disorders and brain damage in children. 

If you especially enjoy being lied to, visit vaccinateyourbaby.org, where they tell you formaldehyde is safe because it is ""present in the environment and is a byproduct of metabolism, so it is already present in the human body."" They also inform you that aluminum is good for you, because ""[a]luminum is also commonly found in food, water, infant formula and even breast milk."" Hey, if it's in the environment, it must be safe to inject into your veins (so why not use snake venom, bleach, and plutonium?).

Water, plants, and early human habitats in eastern Africa 

'..Given the magnitude and variability in water availability revealed by our reconstructions, we hypothesize freshwater springs were important for hominin subsistence in highly variable environments..' 

Water and its inﬂuence on plants likely exerted strong adaptive pressures in human evolution. Understanding relationships among water, plants, and early humans is limited both by incomplete terrestrial records of environmental change and by indirect proxy data for water availability. 

Here we present a continuous record of stable hydrogen-isotope compositions (expressed as δD values) for lipid biomarkers preserved in lake sediments from an early Pleistocene archaeological site in eastern Africa—Olduvai Gorge. 

We convert sedimentary leaf- and algal-lipid δD values into estimates for ancient source-water δD values by accounting for biochemical, physiological, and environmental inﬂuences on isotopic fractionation via published water–lipid enrichment factors for living plants, algae, and recent sediments. 

Reconstructed precipitation and lake water δD values, respectively, are consistent with modern isotopic hydrology and reveal that dramatic ﬂuctuations in water availability accompanied ecosystem changes. 
Drier conditions, indicated by less negative δD values, occur in association with stable carbon-isotopic evidence for open, C4-dominated grassland ecosystems. 

Wetter conditions, indicated by lower δD values, are associated with expanded woody cover across the ancient landscape. Estimates for ancient precipitation amounts, based on reconstructed precipitation δD values, range between approximately 250 and 700 mm·y−1 and are consistent with modern precipitation data for eastern Africa. 

We conclude that freshwater availability exerted a substantial inﬂuence on eastern African ecosystems and, by extension, was central to early human proliferation during periods of rapid climate change.

FW14-e122-7265-06	"WASHINGTON—U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists and their colleagues have conducted research showing the potential response of rangeland plants in arid regions of the United States to the conditions that will occur with climate change, according to a paper published today in Nature. 
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) biological technician Melissa Reyes-Fox and Fort Lewis College assistant professor Heidi Steltzer were the lead co-authors on the paper. ARS is USDA's chief intramural scientific research agency, and the research supports the USDA priority of responding to climate change. 
""Agricultural producers want to know how global climate change is affecting their production and management practices,"" said ARS Administrator Chavonda Jacobs-Young. ""This work is one example of how ARS scientists are helping producers meet climate change challenges and continue the cost-effective and environmentally sustainable production of food and feed."" 
In a 5-year investigation, the researchers assessed the effects of increased temperatures and carbon dioxide levels on plants growing in a native mixed-grass prairie. For their study, they used a field system called Free-Air CO2 Enrichment to elevate current levels of carbon dioxide to 600 parts per million, the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide that is expected in the latter half of this century. Outdoor heaters in the fields kept air temperatures at current levels and at day and night temperatures that were 2.7 and 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than ambient temperatures. 
The scientists tracked leaf emergence, flower production, seed maturation, and canopy senescence in four grasses, a shrub, and a forb common to northern mixed-grass prairie plant communities. The resulting yearly data trends indicated that the plants responded to warmer temperatures with earlier leaf emergence and flowering. Some species also responded with earlier seed maturation and canopy senescence. On average, the growing season for plant communities exposed to higher temperatures began five days earlier and lasted six days longer. 
However, when plants were exposed to a combination of warmer temperatures and elevated carbon dioxide levels, the growing season began seven days earlier and lasted 14 days longer. The researchers believe that elevated carbon dioxide levels prompt greater water conservation in some of the grassland plants, which in turn delayed early plant senescence and death. 
A plant community gets a jump-start on its growing season when the first species leafs out earlier in the spring, and the growing season continues until the last species enters senescence in the fall. So while warming temperatures can increase the length of the growing season in some grasslands communities by promoting earlier spring growth, elevated carbon dioxide levels can help plants conserve water and delay fall senescence.﻿

Precipitation allowed grassland plants to take root in the shifting sand, eventually stabilising the dunes and today it's a region of mixed-grass prairie. 
Another unique aspect of the Sandhills is that it is resting on on of the largest aquifers in the world. The Ogallala Aquifer consist of 1 billion acre-feet of ground water and comes above the surface at the base of many dunes meaning the Sandhills is a region of dry and sandy grassland dunes with many thousand lakes and wetland scattered between them.

FW14-e122-7265-04	"Ever since Daniel Eggert first fell in love with pasque flowers, among the first flowers of spring, he had wanted to photograph them covered in hoar frost. Now it was pasque-flower time once again. He had already identified a spot of chalky grassland near his home where the plants grew, on the rim of the Nördlinger Ries crater (a meteor crater) in Bavaria, Germany. So as soon as a cold, frosty, sunny dawn was forecast, Daniel headed up the hill. ""I found the ideal flowers to photograph, but I didn't have much time,"" he says, ""because I knew that as soon as the sun rose, the frost would quickly melt."" He took this image just as the rising sun began to bathe the hill in a wonderful orange light. ""I love the colors,"" he says, ""and the contrast between the warm background and the cold ice.""

FW14-e122-7250-09	"UCTD (UNDIFFERENTIATED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE) VS LUPUS: A WASTE BASKET TERM OR A REAL DISEASE? 

Read on... 

Annmarie H. asks, ""Dr T.. Your posts have been incredibly informative and I am grateful for you sharing your knowledge . I was hoping you could post some information on uctd. ... Thank you"" 

ANSWER: First things first... anyone who carries a diagnosis of UCTD... you DO have an illness and your doctor is not putting you in to a ""waste basket"" term. Try not to not feel like you are in limbo at all. Instead... educate yourself and consider taking Plaquenil when you get the diagnosis (and use sunscreen religiously every day, get my vitamin D level above 40 ng/mL, exercise regularly, not smoke, and eat omega-3 fatty acids daily [walnuts, flax seed, tofu, cold water fish] all of which would potentially help.) 

""Connective tissue disease"" is the same as ""collagen vascular disease"" and ""systemic autoimmune disease"". ""Undifferentiated"" means that this person has evidence of an inflammatory disorder that appers to be involving the entire body, possibly an autoimmune disorder, but has not ""differentiated"" itself, or made itself 100% clear yet. 

Of special note... UCTD and MCTD are often mixed up... not only by patients, but also by doctors to include rheumatologists. Countless times I have diagnosed someone with UCTD only to see the diagnosis changed to MCTD by another physician. Here is information on MCTD in a previous article of mine: https://plus.google.com/106749088806096753384/posts/HiAREYW9sMe 

Some Facts to ponder regarding this diagnosis: 

\- The systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis, scleroderma, and vasculitis sometimes come on very slowly, only showing one problem or blood test at a time. 

\- We rely upon classification criteria to make a diagnosis of these disorders. 

\- These disorders can cause very similar problems. All of the following can occur in every single one of them: fatigue, pain, arthritis, rash, interstitial lung disease, pleurisy, Raynaud's. 

\- These disorders can all cause the following blood test results: ANA, RF, SSA, RNP, anemia, high ESR, high CRP, low white blood cell count 

\- So... if someone develops the above problems and blood tests but the disease has not fully declared itself yet and does not satisfy criteria, it is called a ""UCTD"". It is still a disease. 

\- Just to throw in a wrench... we as humans like to pigeon hole everything with a word... and why shouldn't we? The systemic autoimmune diseases may be too complex for this. Why is every lupus patient different? Why do we say that one person with recurrent blood clots and Raynauds has systemic lupus and we give the same disease name to a person who has kidney inflammation, arthritis and a butterfly rash? Many feel that systemic lupus actually is many different diseases... and that the systemic autoimmune diseases are caused by the same genes, same environmental triggers, but that each person may just end up getting different autoimmune problems and manifestations... we just want to try to call each one a certain name. Well, UCTD is one of those names. 

\- Even though we may not know exactly which one it is, we can still treat it. For example, we would treat Raynaud's and arthritis similarly whether we end up calling this disorder ""lupus"" or ""Sjogren's syndrome"" or ""UCTD"" in the long run. 

\- Over time, about 1/3 cases of UCTD just goes away. We believe that these cases were due to a viral infection causing systemic inflammation and masquerading as a UCTD (e.g parvovirus). I always wish my patients ended up in this category. 

\- 1/3 of cases evolve over time into one of the well described systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus. 

\- 1/3 of the time the UCTD stays the same and doesn't get any worse. 

\- Taking Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) daily can decrease the chances of UCTD evolving into a more severe case of systemic lupus over time ... If I had UCTD, I would want to take Plaquenil immediately (it is so safe compared to possibly evolving to a severe case of SLE). I would also use sunscreen religiously every day, get my vitamin D level above 40 ng/mL, exercise regularly, not smoke, and eat omega-3 fatty acids daily (walnuts, flax seed, tofu, cold water fish) all of which would help. 

Please SHARE this with every UCTD person you know. There is not very much out on the internet about it, and the ACR does not have a good pamphlet about it to educate patients.

FW14-e122-7242-08	"( Faces of Abducted Canadian Children ) ABDUCTED from CANADA to POLAND - Alexander & Christopher Watkins - (Press “See More” below) - Stephen Watkins is a member of the iCHAPEAU Association. Stephen Watkins is a Canadian citizen and father of ALEXANDER WATKINS (aka: Aleksander Ustaszewski) and CHRISTOPHER WATKINS (aka: Krzysztof Ustaszewski) also known world-wide in the news and through social media as the ""Watkins Missing Children"" from Canada. Both Alexander and Christopher were born in Canada and their father, Stephen Watkins, was granted sole custody by the Ontario Courts in January 26, 2009 after a 7-day trial with liberal access visits every second weekend to their mother. 

PHOTO: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=412068622193132 

The boys were living with their mother, Edyta ( Ustaszewski / Ustaszewska ) Watkins, initially upon separation in 2004 with a Joint Custody Agreement finalized through the Ontario Courts in 2006 but the children were later apprehended by the Children’s Aid Society and the Ontario Courts in 2007 after reports were made by the teachers of the children’s school and daycare of serious child protection concerns. The boys lived with their father full time since 2007 until they were internationally abducted out of Canada 6-weeks after the courts January 26, 2009 ruling. Stephen Watkins was married to Edyta Watkins ( Ustaszewski / Ustaszewska ) and has been fighting to bring his sons back to Canada after they were abducted by their non-custodial mother, missing for 2.5 years and then found living under different names in the country of Poland. Alexander & Christopher Watkins have been held in Poland against the father’s will more than 3 years. 

Alexander & Christopher Watkins were abducted internationally from Canada into the United States then to Europe on March 6, 2009 with the use of a ""Canceled"" Canadian Passport by the non-custodial Mother, Edyta Watkins and two Canadian Passports for the children where she refused to turn over to the Ontario Courts who ordered their return on multiple court appearances. The Ontario Courts failed to enforce their own orders and did not take any action even though the issue of an International Child Abduction was very likely which was brought up by the father’s legal council to the Judge during the custody trial in December 2008. The Abducting mother's Drivers License and Canadian Passport had been confirmed Canceled by the Ontario Government and confirmed by the Ombudsman of Passport Canada 42-Days prior to the abduction of the Watkins Children due to Provincial Enforcement measures from non-payment of Child Support. The children's Canadian Passports were ordered by the Courts to be handed over repeatedly, with the non-custodial Mother refusing to comply. U.S. Homeland Security confirmed with Canadian Authorities that all three flew Delta Airlines Flight 51 to Frankfort Germany using 3-Canadian Passports. 

Poland, who has been a non-complaint member of the Hague Convention for years has ordered the two Canadian children NOT to return home to Canada even though they were in hiding for more than 1.5 years either in Germany or in Poland. In addition, in contravention to the Hague Convention procedures, it took the Polish Courts 11-months to contact the searching father and Canadian authorities on the whereabouts of the missing Canadian boys even though another Polish Court already had a Hague Convention Application field by Canadian authorities and Ordered Polish Police to search Poland-wide on January 8, 2010. Polish Court papers documents that as early as September 14, 2010 show that the missing / abducted Canadian boys were living in the owned residence of the Edyta’s father, Tadeusz (TED) Ustaszewski, in Warsaw Poland. Polish Police later confirmed this information with York Regional Police in Canada. Tadeusz Ustaszewski, who lives in Canada, had refused to help York Regional Police help locate the missing children. 

To make matters worse, while the boys were in hiding without the knowledge of their father or the Canadian Authorities, they were secretly enrolled into a Polish School in 2010 with different names without the knowledge by Polish Police authorities. In 2010 the Polish School witnessed child protection concerns and brought a court action themselves against the mother in the Polish Courts where her parental rights were ordered “Limited” by the Courts. Neither the Polish School nor the Polish Courts contacted the Polish Police to check to see if there were any Police reports issued for the children. The Polish courts assigned a Court Appointed Guardian to oversee the children’s welfare in Poland, but due to polish language issues, they left the boys in the direct care of the accused mother. 

Their grandfather, Tadeusz (TED) Ustaszewski, in Canada was charged by York Regional Police (YRP) in Ontario with assisting in this International Child Abduction and the children's disappearance. He solely picked up the boys at their schools in Newmarket for a supervised weekend visit with their non-custodial mother but instead drove all of them across into the United States and left them at a U.S. Tim Horton's coffee shop before returning alone to Canada. The boys were to be brought back to their school in Newmarket the next day as he had previously done many times before. 

In a criminal court case ruling against the grandfather in the ""Watkins Missing Children"" International Child Abduction held on August 23, 2012 the Canadian Courts found the maternal father, Tadeusz Ted Ustaszewski, GUILTY of assisting his daughter and the non-custodial mother, Edyta Ustaszewska, in the International Parental Child Abduction Case of Alexander Watkins & Christopher Watkins. Sentencing and victim impact statements are scheduled for October 24, 2012 in the Newmarket Courts, Ontario, Canada. 

It was also communicated by his Honor in the Criminal Courts that with the guilty finding of Tadeusz Ustaszewski in this case that it had also been determined that the abducting non-custodial mother, Edyta Ustaszewska, was also clearly in breach of Canadian Laws in this international kidnapping but the Country of Poland has yet to take any actions against the non-custodial mother who's name appears on the RCMP's ""Canada most Wanted"" list and on and INTERPOL ""Red Notice"" issued by Canada since 2010. Both Canada and Poland are both signatories of the INTERPOL treaty. 

Even though the Polish lower Courts have refused to Order the Canadian boys back to Canada, Stephen Watkins is now fighting and brining this case before the Superior Courts of Poland for the return of his sons back to Canada. Like so many other left behind parents in the same situation around the world, he feels like he is doing it alone with not only dealing with his metal anguish of not being able to see his own child but also being burden with huge costs of paying for courts, lawyers and translations. 

Poland has a long history of non-compliance when returning abducted children through the “Hague Convention On The Civil Aspects Of International Child Abduction” and Poland is also signatory of the “U.N. Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT)” and the “U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)” where International Child Abduction is addressed which is why Stephen Watkins believes that the only way Polish Government will comply to the Hague Convention is if the Canadian government helps to enforce treaties that Poland or other nations are signatories to bring back home Canadian citizens.

FW14-e122-7242-09	"( Faces of Abducted Canadian Children ) ABDUCTED from CANADA to BRAZIL - Alice Pires Caetano - (Press “See More” below) - Cesar Pimenta Caetano is a member of the iCHAPEAU Association. Cesar Pimenta is a Canadian citizen with Brazilian heritage and father of Alice Pires Caetano, who was born in Toronto Canada, nine years ago. He was married to Luciana Pires Caetano and has been fighting to bring his daughter back to Canada after she was wrongfully retained in Brazil. Alice has been held in Brazil against the father’s will more than 3 years. It's important to highlight this abduction is recurrent, as Alice was held in Brazil by her mother some years before. 

PHOTO: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=409882319078429 

In October 2003, his former wife was still without legal status in Canada and went to Brazil on a condition of waiting for immigration documents. After 15 days, she said that she would not return to Canada any more. 

Urgently, the father filed complaint of international kidnapping to the Ontario Central Authority of Canada who immediately sent the complaint to the Hague Central Authority of Brazil. 

The process was left in hold, forgotten in Brazil; however, the taking parent had regretted the illegal act and returned to Canada to live with her husband in December 2005. They lived together until 2007 when the couple separated. 

In July 2008, custody was given to the mother, with visitation rights for the father, but the Order was made with these important points: 

~Court Order July 15, 2008 - Paragraph~ 

# 3 - The Applicant (mother) shall not remove the child from Canada without the written consent of respondent. 

# 5 - The Respondent waives the requirement of parental consent for the applicant to travel with the child outside Ontario, Canada if the travel is 45 days or less. If more than 45 days, consent will not be unreasonably withheld by Respondent. The Applicant will provide a contact number and address of travel destination to Respondent for emergency purposes and telephone access. 

In October 2009, the father was going back to court to increase his visitation order with his daughter but the mother had delayed the court matter 3 times. The 3rd court date was scheduled for October 29, 2009 but records show that the mother had fled Canada on October 28, the day before the court date. 

As soon she arrived in Brazil, she went into hiding. 

The left behind father again reported the Central Authority of Canada this situation in February 2010 and only in August 2010 the Brazilian attorneys had request judicial enforcement of the Hague Convention. 

The Brazilian government attorneys were careless and inept leaving this case in limbo for a substantially time, damaging the child which should be in Canada, growing and developing in the country that she was born. Alice has been missing the chance to be with her loving and heartbroken father regardless if the mother decided to move back to Brazil. 

The abducting mother used a Women’s shelter named Interim Place in Mississauga, Ontario as a shield to keep her daughter in Brazil by reporting violence without any supporting evidence or investigations by Canadian Police, Children’s Aid Agencies or by Doctors / Hospital records. 

The Interim Place shelter forwarded a letter and their own internal notes directly to Brazilian Court in support of the mother without verifying any of the facts or without providing a clear indication of the source of the allegations. 

Considering Interim Place is not an authority agency in Canada, the Brazilian Courts utilized these case notes and treated them as “fact” rather then allegations. In any reasonable court situation, this amounts to heresy testimony from the Abducting parent to justify their abduction and the preponderance of evidence, as required by the Hague Convention was not met, but still utilized by the Brazilian courts to harbour and retain Alice Caetano from being ordered returned to Canada. 

In attempts to have Interim Place communicate to the Brazilian Courts a statement of clear facts of the supporting evidence and to clarify the notes which they provided directly to the Brazilian Courts, letters were forwarded in and around September 29, 2011 to Interim Place by Canada’s Foreign Affairs and by the Ministry of the Attorney General who operates the Ontario Central Hague Authority. 

In the letter issued by the Ministry of the Attorney General on September 29, 2011 to Interim Place, it stated that; 

“The respondent, mother as named above has absconded with the child, and has made claims abroad that she was abused to due to the fact that she was in your facility.” 

The letter goes on to state that; 

“Traditionally, women who are factually being abused by their partners seek refuge in facilities such as yours, attend court to obtain the appropriate court orders and file a report with the local police.” 

The Ministry of the Attorney General letter then states these facts; 

“Records have been checked and there is NO RELEVANT report with respect to abuse against the mother. She also did not obtain a court order or consent to take the child out of the country; however you housed her and the child and have not provided any causes for your involvement.” 

In addition to these important facts the Ministry of the Attorney General also goes on to state; 

“Although the safety of the mother is surly paramount, the interest of the child was not at all considered when assisting this mother. The respondent mother is a repeat abductor and should your facility conduct sufficient checks on the clientèle, that information would have been realized.” 

After no response was given immediately by Interim Place and in order to put pressure on Interim Place to have meetings or to respond to the previous letters issued by the Canadian and Ontario governments. Cesar Caetano shot a video at one of Interim Place’s public events on July 29, 2012 to show how this organization was handling and avoiding the issues. 

SEE THE VIDEO HERE: Bring Alice Home: 

After waiting over 1 year, a letter was issued on October 4, 2012 by Galldin & Robertson Feminist Lawyers Association Law Firm retained by Interim Place to the Ministry off the Attorney General. In this letter, they completely ignored the Ministry off the Attorney General September 29, 2011 request of information when asking these questions; 

“The mother has made many claims against the father to the Ontario Court and has not been able to prove the violence against her. What recourse is taken to prove a woman claiming to be abused by her partner prior your assistance? What advocacy was applied with the mother; did you help her in court or attend the police station to support her while making a police statement?” 

Instead, Interim Place, through their lawyers issued the following statement in their letter; 

“Without a signed release, Interim Place cannot discuss information shared by any current, or past, client or resident. Interim Place staff and volunteers are not able to confirm whether someone has accessed services or whether someone was a resident of the shelter. Therefore, Interim Place is not able to discuss any details of the confidential services staff may have provided Mr. Caetano’s former partner.” 

Considering that the Abducting mother has allegedly committed a criminal offence of Canada of child abduction and is purposely hiding in another country, it seems controversial that Interim Place would require her signature for the release of information when being requested directly by Ministry of the Attorney General in a Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction case? 

Cesar Caetano is still fighting in the Brazilian courts for the return of his Canadian daughter back to Canada. In international cases, it is more complicated when such organizations as Interim Place support international child abductions by NOT conducting sufficient background checks or screening of their clientèle in addition to providing unsupported evidence by the abducting patent to foreign nations court system without any authoritative supporting evidence or investigations by the Canadian Courts, Police, Children’s Aid Agencies, by Doctors or Hospitals. 

Like so many other left behind parents in the same situation around the world, he feels like he is doing it alone with not only dealing with his metal anguish of not being able to see his own child but also being burden with huge costs of paying for courts, lawyers and translations. 

Brazil has a long history of non-compliance when returning abducted children through the “Hague Convention On The Civil Aspects Of International Child Abduction” which is why Cesar believes that the only way Brazilian Government will comply to the Hague Convention is if the Canadian government helps to enforce treaties that Brazil or other nations are signatories to bring back home Canadian citizens.

Sep 2, 2013 4:35pm 

Alligators heavier than 700 pounds sound straight out of a nightmare for most, but they became record-breaking reality for hunters in Mississippi over the weekend. Two groups of hunters smashed the record for largest gator in the state, not once but twice during opening weekend of alligator season. 

Beth Trammell of Madison, and her team of five broke the previous record of 697.5 pounds early Saturday morning by reeling in a 723.5 pound mammoth. “When we first saw him,” she recalls, “I yelled ‘oh my gosh we caught the Loch Ness Monster!’” It took five hours and the help of two additional hunters, but eventually they hoisted the animal into their boat. “It was totally unbelievable,” Trammell remembers. 

Her record, however, was defeated two hours later by Dustin Bockman, another amateur who managed to wrangle in a 727-pound male, his very first catch. He and two partners struggled with the record-breaker for over four hours in the early morning before pulling him to a sandbar to wait for help. “My goal was to get a 10-footer,” he explained. “I couldn’t believe it when it was that big.” 

These massive creatures come as no surprise to Ricky Flint, Mississippi Alligator Program coordinator. This is the first year there has been a state-wide alligator season, opening up massive new hunting territory to those picked via lottery. “We expect the records to get broken and these will be broken, as well. Maybe before the end of this season,” he said. 

For this challenge, Bockman is ready. “If someone beats my record, I’ll go out and try to top it.” While regulations will force him to wait until next season to reel in anything that large, he remains optimistic. “There’s always a bigger one out there.” Until then, both Trammell and Bockman will mount their harvests to remember their struggles. Trammell is planning a party next weekend to enjoy the meat with friends.

The record setting croc appears to be having a positive impact on conservation, with new resolutions being introduced in the Philippine Senate designed to strengthen laws protecting the saltwater and Philippine crocodile, a species considered critically endangered.

Maximum Length: Up to 5 feet 
Maximum Weight: Up to 154 pounds A True Goliath: When your name is ""Goliath,"" you'd better be one humongous, ferocious creature, and the goliath tigerfish definitely lives up to its moniker. A native of the Congo River basin, the Lualaba River, Lake Upemba and Lake Tanganyika in Africa, it's the largest member of the tigerfish clan, a genus of fierce predators with protruding, daggerlike teeth. The biggest one on record was nearly 5 feet long and weighed 154 pounds, the equivalent of a super-welterweight prizefighter. And it outclasses other African game fish in speed and power. No Fear: Locals say it's the only fish that doesn't fear the crocodile and that it actually eats smaller ones. It's also been known to attack humans in rare instances. It's so lightning quick and forceful that not only will it snap an angler's line, but it will sometimes make off with his or her tackle. No wonder one fishing safari promoter requires clients read a cautionary treatise on the goliath before agreeing to a fishing trip. Slice and Dice: The goliath tigerfish likes turbulent waters, where fish who are less powerful swimmers struggle against the current, rendering them vulnerable to attack. It has excellent eyesight and the ability to sense low-frequency vibrations emitted by prey. It generally circles the unlucky fish before striking with the brutality of a piranha. The goliath has been known to pounce on a 60-pound catfish and literally slice it in half. Scary, huh? The goliath's lifespan in the wild is uncertain, but they've lasted 10 to 15 years in captivity.﻿

FW14-e122-7249-09	"The Alligator Gar (""Gator Gar""), Atractosteus spatula, is a primitive ray-finned fish. Unlike other Gars, the mature Alligator Gar possesses a dual row of large teeth in the upper jaw. Its name derives from the alligator-like appearance of these teeth along with the fish's elongated snout. The dorsal surface of the Alligator Gar is a brown or olive color, while the ventral surface tends to be lighter. Their scales are diamond-shaped and interlocking (ganoid) and are sometimes used by Native Americans for jewelry and arrow heads. 
Along with its status as the largest species of Gar, the Alligator Gar is the largest exclusively freshwater fish found in North America, measuring 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) and weighing at least 200 lb (91 kg) at maturity. The largest Alligator Gar caught by net was caught by Kenny Williams, from Vicksburg, Mississippi, in February 2011, [1] and measured 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m) long, 327 lb (148 kg) in weight, and nearly 48 in ( 120 cm) around. The fish is believed to have been between 50 and 70 years old, wildlife officials said. Williams has donated the fish to the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson where it will be on permanent display in the future. The current world record for the largest Alligator Gar caught on rod and reel is 279 lb (127 kg). [Note 1] [2] The largest taken by bowfishing is 365 lb (166 kg). [Note 2] [3] The fish is also known for its ability to survive outside the water, being able to last for up to two hours above the surface.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_gar

FW14-e122-7274-08	"Kevin Alfred from FB 

During the oil boom of the 1910s, the area of northeast Oklahoma around Tulsa flourished, including the Greenwood neighborhood, which came to be known as ""the Negro Wall Street"" (now commonly referred to as ""the Black Wall Street"")[3] The area was home to several prominent black businessmen, many of them multimillionaires. Greenwood boasted a variety of thriving businesses that were very successful up until the Tulsa Race Riot. Not only did African Americans want to contribute to the success of their own shops, but also the racial segregation laws prevented them from shopping anywhere other than Greenwood.[4] Following the riots, the area was rebuilt and thrived until the 1960s when ((((((desegregation allowed blacks to shop in areas that were restricted before)))))). 
Detroit Avenue, along the edge of Standpipe Hill, contained a number of higher-end houses belonging to doctors, lawyers and business owners. Also, the buildings on Greenwood Avenue housed the offices of almost all of Tulsa’s black lawyers, realtors, doctors, and other professionals.[5] In Tulsa at the time of the riot, there were fifteen well-known African American physicians, one of whom, Dr. A.C. Jackson, was considered the “most able Negro surgeon in America” by one of the Mayo brothers.[6] Dr. Jackson was shot to death as he left his house during the riot.[2] Greenwood published two newspapers, the Tulsa Star and the Oklahoma Sun, which covered not only Tulsa, but also state and national news and elections. Buildings housing the two papers were destroyed during the riot.[2] 
Greenwood was a very religiously active community. At the time of the riot there were more than a dozen African American churches and many Christian youth organizations and religious societies. 
In northeastern Oklahoma, as elsewhere in America, the prosperity of minorities emerged amidst racial and political tension. The Ku Klux Klan made its first major appearance in Oklahoma shortly before the worst race riot in history.[7] It is estimated that there were about 3,200 members of the Klan in Tulsa in 1921 .﻿

FW14-e122-7274-03	"Moment in time: April 11, 1981 -- Rioting erupts in Brixton 

It was a riot waiting to happen. Brixton was far from tourist London, a noisy neighbourhood rooted in postwar immigration from the Caribbean where police routinely stopped and searched residents simply because they were black. One Friday afternoon, an officer tried to grab a young man who'd been bloodied in a fight. The subsequent chase started a riot that turned into a conflagration. Within a day, prim and proper London looked more like Detroit - buildings were gutted, overturned police cars burned on the street, shops were looted and hundreds of bused-in officers had been injured. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused to accept policing and youth unemployment as underlying causes, but subsequent investigations curbed the inflammatory tactics and denounced the London force's institutional racism. -- John Allemang

And with all of these problems it is remarkable that labor-management matters soon cooled down and production exploded to the point where Detroit was declared the “Arsenal of Democracy.” The Willow Run plant was turning out 600 B-24 bombers a month by the end of the war. Pilots slept on cots waiting for takeoff as the B-24′s rolled off the assembly line. M5 tanks, jeeps, artillery pieces and myriad  war materials spilled out of other factories in Detroit. Sadly, racial tensions were not resolved and the 1943 Detroit race riot killed 25 blacks, 9 whites and wounded 433 over 36 hours. Federal troops were brought in to restore order. Following the violence, Japanese propaganda officials incorporated the event into materials encouraging black soldiers not to fight for the U.S. In spite of the Detroit’s job discrimination, housing discrimination, police brutality and frequent animosity from Detroit’s white population, blacks served loyally and with distinction in all of America’s Armed Services.""

I, probably much like you (unless you have never seen a tape in which case go play your ipod and debate about #io6 on another post... :) ), Have been putting this off forever. I had a box stuffed deep in the basement, that was full of tapes I loved as a child. There is also several of me singing and few mix tapes I wouldn't mind remembering. But make them into mp3s? ""Someday""... Today was that day.. and You should to. It wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be. 

*5 Steps To Getting Your Cassettes Into Mp3s* 

Step 1 - Download Audacity - http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ Pc mac linux all available.. and its free 

Step 2 - Find a tape device. Although not the best quality I used a stereo cable from the headphone to the line in on my computer. After a few tweaks with my setting the ""line in appeared"" in Audacity and we were good to go. 

Step 3 - Make a test recording for 30 seconds or so. Hit play on tape. Hit Record on Software. Yup worked? Good. 

Step 4 - Record a full side and then export. It will export as a wav file. 

Step 5 - Open up Itunes, Load the wav file in and then convert it to MP3. 

All done.  Took longer for me to write this post out and I'm glad its off the checklist of ""to do someday that will never come"".

FW14-e122-7274-05	"According to the author Philip Womack the London riots ""are not Ballardian"" despite the fact that J.G. Ballard wrote about social breakdown in Kingdom Come and High Rise. Womack writes that Ballard's concern was the middle classes - a group Womack clearly believes are different in kind from the young rioters looting London for the past three nights. ""What Ballard pointed up was just how thin that layer is. And it's a layer that is completely absent from these rioters... They have no consciences to be removed in the first place."" Womack believes, ""the only way to solve this is to get in there and talk, and show that every action, mindless or not, has its equal and opposite reaction. We need to show unity, and show these children that their actions are not a form of freedom."" I don't find Womack credible. We don't talk to people we believe are ""mindless."" 

The blogger, Penny Red, is far more credible when she asserts that, ""Violence is rarely mindless. The politics of a burning building, a smashed-in shop or a young man shot by police may be obscured even to those who lit the rags or fired the gun, but the politics are there. "" Perhaps the riots are Eugenidesisn - in his book Middlesex, Jeffery Eugenides asks if what happened in 1967 in Detroit ""was a riot or a guerrilla uprising?"" He answers his questions with a series of questions: ""After the riot was over, were, or were there not, caches of weapons found all over the neighborhood? And Were these weapons, or were they not, AK-47s and machine guns? And why had General Throckmorton deployed his tanks on the East Side, Miles from rioting? Was that the kind of thing you did to subdue an unorganized gang of snipers? Or was it more in keeping with military strategy? Was it like establishing a front line in a war?"" 

2011 is not 1967. I suspect that we are not calling a revolution a riot, but that does not mean that those dismissing the violence on the streets of London ""as ‘pure criminality,’ as the work of a ‘violent minority’, as ‘opportunism.’"" aren't also making a categorical error. I agree with Penny Red: ""This is madly insufficient."" 

What questions should we be asking about the implosion of London? Do we have to credit the looters and muggers with political intent to ask if what is happening is a riot or an uprising? Are the social networking tools being used to coordinate actions? Will authorities in England use tactics simular to those used in the Middle East to restore order? Is the lack of any ideological intent the same mindlessness? If middle class political commentators like +Ezra Klein can advocate ""anything that works,"" what should we expect from a spontaneous youth uprising? 

I don't imagine that we are witnessing a Anglo Spring. I am worried for my British friends and very sad that a great city is in flames. But as Nate Silver pointed out on twitter yesterday ""High unemployment and lack of homeownership among minority communities are historically correlated with riots."" As the gap between rich and poor continues to widen throughout the english speaking world, I do find myself wondering what it is we are witnessing.﻿

FW14-e122-7274-06	"Tell us a little about yourself,and your race relations tales of Detroit. 

Interview with Gregory A.Fournier author of Zug Island A Detroit Riot Novel. 

2.Why dredge up Detroit's painful race history. 

Is this a story that needs to be told?Set in 1967 against a backdrop of industrial blight and urban decay,Racism on the mean streets of Detroit comes in every shade of color. 

3.Will African-Americans find the race language of Zug Island offensive?. 

I use profanity and racial slurs to give my dialogue the ring of truth. It is a blue collar story about the workplace. I hope everyone who reads my novel is offended by that language. That was my intention. 

4.How did you get the idea for writing Zug Island and how long did it take you? When I was walking off the island and was ""punching out"" at the time clock for the last time, an an man named ""Pop"" yelled out to me and waved, ""Don't forget to write a book about us college boy."" I half-laughted and replied, ""I will."" Mine is a story I've waited over forty-five years to write. 

5.Why do you call Zug Island a novel rather than a memoir? I've changed the names of people and several of the plot race elements. Mainly to avoid litigation. 

6.Is the image on your front cover authentic or is it a stock photograph?It does look Detroit! The cover photo is the exact location which readers of Zug Island will recognize instantly. 

7.Share the coming of age story on chapter 8 race and the Vietnam war. 

Vietnam and the draft was a reality for everyone in the Sixties. It was a turning point for my generation and for our culture. Truth about race and fiction mix heavily in this chapter. I work my way back to college while my friend waits to be shipped out in the morning. Author's note: I mispelled Dina Washington's name in this chapter; I wrote Diana instead. 

8.What race research did you do before and during your writing of Zug Island? Vintage newspaper accounts, the internet, several books on the subject listed on my novel's website and my personal experiences. 

9.What are some marketing tips you can share with us.What would you do different? Get a professional looking website for your book, develop a blogging habit to build an audience, and win some writing contests, even small bragging rights are better than none. Facebook ads did not work for me. Also, instead of making appearances this summer, I will concentrate on web radio and internet opportunities and talk more openly about race in Detroit. 

10.Final comment:What's on your ""Bucket List?"" Top 5 things you'd still like to do? 

Finish my next project about serial killer John Norman Collins called In the Shadow of the Water Tower, help my children get into the housing market, live to see my grandchildren grow and prosper, and see American leave its legacy of racism on the trash heap of history and the end of negative race talk as we know it.﻿

I found an image on telegraph.co.uk where FSA terrorist loading their magazines during clashes with Syrian Army in the Salaheddine neighbourhood. 

As far as i can see on this picture it looks like they are using led tip ammunition which are illegal and a war crime. 

""The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibits the use in international warfare of bullets which easily expand or flatten in the body, giving as example a bullet with a jacket with incisions or one that does not fully cover the core.[14] This is often incorrectly believed to be prohibited in the Geneva Conventions, but it significantly predates those conventions, and is in fact a continuance of the Declaration of St Petersburg in 1868, which banned exploding projectiles of less than 400 grams.""

FW14-e122-7274-09	"Use of Deadly Force, Detention and Interrogation of U.S. Civilians 

According to a variety of sources, Garden Plot has been activated a number of times since the 1960s. In fact, up until 1971 there were multiple standing brigades stationed in the U.S. for domestic civil disturbance operations. According to GlobalSecurity.org, Garden Plot was activated during the Los Angeles riots in 1992, during the Detroit riots in 1967, and following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. After the creation of USNORTHCOM in 2002, Garden Plot was replaced with CONPLAN 2502 (now referred to as CONPLAN 3502). There are only a few known references to this CONPLAN in the military literature we can find. One of the most significant resources when trying to learn about the CONPLAN is the Domestic Operational Handbook for Judge Advocates, “a resource for operational lawyers involved in domestic support operations” that helps them understand “the legal issues inherent in such operations”. The Domestic Operational Handbook for 2010 includes many references to CONPLAN 3502, including notes that indicate that the plan contains information on the formation of detention facilities for imprisoning U.S. citizens during Civil Disturbance Operations (CDO). Because of the inherent limitations of the Posse Comitatus Act, only police can lawfully detain and hold civilians. However, page 77 of the 2010 Domestic Operational Law Handbook states: 

If available civilian detention facilities cannot accommodate the number of detained persons who are awaiting arraignment, the Joint Civil Disturbance Task Force commander must seek the approval of the SCRAG and Combatant Commander to set up a temporary detention facility. 

Should the Task Force be required to operate a detention facility, the detention facility standards and operations should conform, to the maximum extent possible, to current DoD confinement facility operations and will be under the professional supervision and control of Military Police personnel. The establishment and operation of military detention facilities is a temporary expedient and is authorized only until such time as the custody of detained persons can be transferred to civil authorities. 

A footnote for this passage indicates that CONPLAN 3502 is to be referenced for further instructions on the construction of these facilities and for related legal issues. The note goes on to say that USNORTHCOM “CONPLAN 3502 . . . specifies that detention facilities be under the control of U.S. Army MP Corps personnel. Due to base closure and increased joint nature of operations it is possible that U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force confinement facilities could be used.” The handbook also describes how “Military forces have the authority to detain rioters, looters or other civilians committing criminal offenses” and that “If civilian police are not available, CID agents or military police may conduct interrogations only if the interrogation is essential to the civil disturbance mission”, indicating that military forces are capable of detaining, holding and interrogating U.S. citizens depending on the exigency of the circumstances. 

The 1991 version of Garden Plot, the precursor to CONPLAN 3502, includes instructions on the use of deadly force against U.S. citizens. Here is a basic listing of the requirements for deadly force found on page C-1-8: 

1 THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE IS AUTHORIZED ONLY WHERE ALL THREE OF THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES ARE PRESENT: 

A LESSER MEANS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED OR ARE UNAVAILABLE; 

B THE RISK OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY HARM TO INNOCENT PERSONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED BY USE; 

AND 

C THE PURPOSE OF ITS USE IS ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: 

1-SELF DEFENSE TO AVOID DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY HARM; SELF DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE PERSON OR FORCE TO AVOID IMMINENT DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY POSED BY THE HOSTILE PERSON; (’96 Change) 

2-PREVENTION OF A CRIME WHICH INVOLVES A SUBSTANTIAL RISK AN IMMIMENT DANGER (’96 Change) OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY HARM (FOR EXAMPLE, SETTING FIRE TO AN INHABITED DWELLING OR SNIPING), INCLUDING THE DEFENSE OF OTHER PERSONS, WHERE DEADLY FORCE IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE PERSON THREATENING TO COMMIT THE CRIME; OR (’96 Change); 

3-PREVENTION OF THE DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES OR SIMILAR PROPERTY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (’96 Change) VITAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY, DAMAGE TO WHICH WOULD IMPERIL LIFE (’96 Change); OR 

4-DETENTION OR PREVENTION OF THE ESCAPE OF PERSONS WHO HAVE COMMITTED OR ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT ONE OF THE SERIOUS OFFENSES REFERRED TO IN SUBPARAGRAPHS 1, 2, AND 3 IMMEDIATELY ABOVE, BUT ONLY IF ESCAPE OF THE PERSONS WOULD POSE AN IMMINENT DANGER OF DEATH OR SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY TO MILITARY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON (’96 Change). 

Page C-8-9 of the same document describes criteria for conducting warrantless searches of people and property, seizure of property, as well as detention operations. Page E-4 specifically describes the role of CONPLANs: “Civil disturbance contingency plans governing the employment of federal forces will include provisions for providing detention assistance to civilian authorities. Plans for this assistance will cover the full range of possible support, from assisting police in guarding detainees to operating detention facilities. Such assistance will be predicated on the turnover of this responsibility to civil authorities as soon as practicable.” 

The 2010 Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) Handbook clarifies the current policy on the use of force, providing templates for soldiers engaged in civil support missions under Title 10 authority. The Handbook provides a relatively complex description of situations where the use of force is authorized, while also describing arming orders for vehicles and soldiers engaged in civil support missions. 

U.S. Army Field Manual 3-19.15 gives complex instructions on searching and detaining individuals, conducting riot control operations, as well as creating “temporary detention facilities”. These detention facilities are to be located on “the nearest military installation or on suitable property under federal control” and “should be close enough to the disturbance area to minimize transportation and escort needs”. The manual emphasizes that these facilities should be built on “existing structures” that are “adapted for this use, but construction may be needed to provide segregation for ensuring effective control and administration.” In Chapter 7, there are even instructions for quelling riots and other disturbances inside these confinement facilities: 

Civil disturbance doctrine is usually written for quelling disturbances that occur in large open areas where the size of the responding force or the type of formation employed is not hampered by a lack of space. However, in the military confinement environment, inmate disturbances often occur in small, closed areas, such as an inmate’s housing unit, a gymnasium, a dining facility, or a chapel where maneuver space and equipment limit the size of the element that may be employed. The layout of each facility is different and presents its own unique problems when employing forces. This chapter covers the use of small military police teams, forced cell move teams (FCMTs), and the formations used to move an unruly inmate from one cell to another﻿

FW14-e122-7274-10	"The Detroit Race Riot, 1943 

For three days in June, 1943, blacks and whites in Detroit fought a battle that killed 34 people, wounded 433, and destroyed more than $2 million in property. The United States has a long history of racial discrimination which periodically erupts in violence such as the Detroit Race Riot. 

The Detroit riot began at a popular and integrated amusement park known as Belle Isle. On the muggy summer evening of June 20, 1943, the playground was ablaze with activity. Several incidents occurred that night including multiple fights between white teenagers who set upon black teenagers. White teenagers were often aided by sailors who were stationed at the Naval Armory nearby. 

As people began leaving the island for home, major traffic jams and congestion at the ferry docks spurred more violence. On the bridge which led back to the mainland, a fight erupted between a total of 200 African Americans and white sailors. Soon, a crowd of 5,000 white residents gathered at the mainland entrance to the bridge ready to attack black vacationers wishing to cross. It didn't take long before they started killing... 

Turn the tables and see how we like it. Labels do not just work one way, they can be used equally by those demonised by us. 

This historical event is meant to be used as a reminder, not because of any hatred for us white people, But to throw back in the faces of white Muslim hating supremacists the pain of labelling so that they may understand how the Muslims feel, when we do it to them!﻿
