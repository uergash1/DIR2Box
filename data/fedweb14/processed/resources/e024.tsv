For example, we’re both passionate about connecting talent with opportunity at massive scale and obsessed with increasing the effectiveness of the job seeking and recruiting processes. At LinkedIn, we’ve invested a lot of time and energy into developing products like “Jobs You…

I began to think about how much my idea of  “home” has shaped my value system. My family hails from Trinidad, where culture and values are deeply intertwined. I’ve found the same to be true here at LinkedIn. Those values and what they taught me were an integral part of how I…
