FW14-e005-7215-03	Treatment of Unresectable and Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma	Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is an already common disorder with a rapidly increasing incidence. Treatment of early disease depends primarily on surgery or destructive techniques. In contrast to the frequency of early SCC, unresectable or metastatic SCC is relatively rare, but potentially life-threatening without clearly proven treatment options. Few rigorous studies of the treatment of advanced SCC have been undertaken. In the past, various agents have been explored in a limited fashion, including chemotherapy (cisplatin, fluoropyrimidines, bleomycin, doxorubicin), 13-cis-retinoic acid, ...

FW14-e005-7167-05	Optimisation of flow balance and isothermal extrusion of aluminium using finite-element simulations	There is significant demand to reduce variations in the shape and mechanical properties of the aluminium extrusion process to meet tighter tolerance requirements. To reduce variations, the flow and temperature evolution in the container and die must be controlled. To study how the process parameters influence the temperature evolution and the material flow, the effects of ram speed, initial temperature distribution in the billet and container cooling rate have been studied. This work is divided into three parts which examine the ...
FW14-e005-7167-03	Friction in aluminium extrusion—Part 1: A review of friction testing techniques for aluminium extrusion	In the aluminium extrusion process, the friction at the workpiece/tooling interface is a highly complex phenomenon, affected by local temperature, relative velocity, contact pressure, geometry and tooling surface roughness, etc. Despite of this understanding, general rules for the selection of friction testing techniques have not been established yet. This paper summarises the recent development of the friction testing techniques for aluminium extrusion processes and detailed comparisons of these techniques are presented. Of the existing friction testing techniques, the combination of extrusion ...
FW14-e005-7167-07	Identification of a friction model for the bearing channel of hot aluminium extrusion dies by using ball-on-disc tests	A physically-based friction model is developed based on the ball-on-disc test results. The model is verified by using double action extrusion tests. Good agreements between the FE predictions and experiments have been obtained, in terms of the extrudate length and steady-state extrusion load, indicating that ball-on-disc test is an effect way of characterizing the friction for the bearing channel of hot extrusion dies. The nature of friction in the bearing channel can be summarized as a pressure dependant process: formation of ...
FW14-e005-7215-08	Translocation (12;14) and other chromosome abnormalities in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue	Abstract  Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has an increasing incidence, a high morbidity rate, and a 50% 5-year survival rate. The prognosis of tongue SCC is poor compared to SCC originating at other sites in the oral cavity, because they represent different biological subentities. Cytogenetic studies of head and neck SCC showed more losses than gains of various chromosomes or chromosomal segments. Among the frequent alterations there are losses of −4, −10, −13, −14, −18, −19, −21, −22, gains of +7, +8, ...
FW14-e005-7167-09	Performance of gas nitrided and AlTiN coated AISI H13 hot work tool steel in aluminium extrusion	The performances of nitrided and AlTiN coated AISI H13 hot work tool steel samples were investigated under conditions similar to those encountered in aluminium extrusion. The compound layer on the surface of the gas nitrided tool steel is entirely removed during sliding contact with aluminium after a sliding length of 3900 m, under a contact load of 60 N exposing the underlying diffusion zone to the aluminium counterface. Aluminium is known to have a strong tendency to adhere to steel and forms an ...

FW14-e005-7167-04	Friction conditions in the bearing area of an aluminium extrusion process	In aluminium extrusion processes, friction inside the bearing channel is important for controlling the surface quality of the extrusion products. The contact materials show a large hardness difference, one being hot aluminium, and the other being hardened tool steel. Further, the contact pressure is high, which means that contact at the bearing–aluminium interface is fully plastic. A load dependent fully plastic friction model has been developed for such fully plastic contact conditions. This roughness based contact model is applied on the ...
FW14-e005-7215-10	Squamous cell carcinoma with clear cells: how often is there evidence of tricholemmal differentiation?	Clear-cell carcinoma of the skin was described by Kuo in 1980 as a cutaneous tumor composed of clear cells that lacked cytoplasmic glycogen or evidence of tricholemmal keratinization. Tricholemmal carcinoma (TC) is conventionally considered to be a neoplasm derived from adnexal keratinocytes with glycogenated clear cells and evidence of outer root sheath or tricholemmal differentiation. The existence of TC has been questioned as it has been argued that without clear immunohistochemical evidence of outer root sheath differentiation, TC cannot be distinguished ...
FW14-e005-7215-09	Glutathione, ascorbic acid and antioxidant enzymes in the tumor tissue and blood of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in the world. Reactive oxygen species are postulated to be involved in neoplastic transformation. The antioxidant defence system limits cell injury induced by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and a cell's oxidant capacity or when there is a decrease in this capacity. This stress may cause mutagenesis, cytotoxicity and changes in gene expression that initiate or ...
FW14-e005-7167-02	Modelling of contact and friction in aluminium extrusion	A physical model capable of predicting the friction and sticking/slipping lengths in the bearing channel during unlubricated aluminium extrusion processes is presented. The model takes into account the pressure build up in the extrusion direction in relation with the bearing – extrudate friction and how it will be influenced by die geometry such as die angle and bearing length. The results show that a high friction coefficient in the bearing will increase the sticking length and shorten the slipping length. The ...

FW14-e005-7250-06	Oxidative Stress and Vascular Disease	Growing evidence indicates that chronic and acute overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under pathophysiologic conditions is integral in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). These ROS can be released from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) oxidase, xanthine oxidase, lipoxygenase, mitochondria, or the uncoupling of nitric oxide synthase in vascular cells. ROS mediate various signaling pathways that underlie vascular inflammation in atherogenesis: from the initiation of fatty streak development through lesion progress to ultimate plaque rupture. Various animal models of oxidative stress ...

FW14-e005-7250-04	Tissue-engineered vascular grafts composed of marine collagen and PLGA fibers using pulsatile perfusion bioreactors.	Novel tubular scaffolds of marine source collagen and PLGA fibers were fabricated by freeze drying and electrospinning processes for vascular grafts. The hybrid scaffolds, composed of a porous collagen matrix and a fibrous PLGA layer, had an average pore size of 150+/-50 microm. The electrospun fibrous PLGA layer on the surface of a porous tubular collagen scaffold improved the mechanical strength of the collagen scaffolds in both the dry and wet states. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs)- and endothelial cells (ECs)-cultured collagen/PLGA ...

FW14-e005-7250-02	High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema Textbook of Pulmonary Vascular Disease	High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is an uncommon form of pulmonary edema that occurs in healthy individuals within a few days of arrival at altitudes above 2,500–3,000 m. The crucial pathophysiology is an excessive hypoxia-mediated rise in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) or hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) leading to increased microvascular hydrostatic pressures despite normal left atrial pressure. The resultant hydrostatic stress can cause both dynamic changes in the permeability of the alveolar capillary barrier and mechanical damage leading to leakage of large ...

Acute coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events have common underlying arterial pathology, risk factors, and preventive treatments, but they are rarely studied concurrently. In the Oxford Vascular Study, we determined the comparative epidemiology of different acute vascular syndromes, their current burdens, and the potential effect of the ageing population on future rates. ...
FW14-e005-7242-10	Convention in joint activity	Conventional behaviors develop from practice for regularly occurring problems of coordination within a community of actors. Reusing and extending conventional methods for coordinating behavior is the task of everyday reasoning. The computational model presented in the paper details the emergence of convention in circumstances where there is no ruling body of knowledge developed by prior generations of actors within the community to guide behavior. The framework we assume combines social theories of cognition with human information processing models that have been ...
FW14-e005-7242-09	Common Knowledge and Convention	This paper investigates the epistemic assumptions that David Lewis makes in his account of social conventions. In particular, I focus on the assumption that the agents have common knowledge of the convention to which they are parties. While evolutionary analyses show that the common knowledge assumption is unnecessary in certain classes of games, Lewis’ original account (and, more recently, Cubitt and Sugden’s reconstruction) stresses the importance of including it in the definition of convention. I discuss arguments pro et contra to ...
FW14-e005-7242-08	Knowledge, Equilibrium and Convention	Abstract  There are two general classes of social conventions: conventions of coordination, and conventions of partial conflict. In coordination problems, the interests of the agents coincide, while in partial conflict problems, some agents stand to gain only if other agents unilaterally make certain sacrifices. Lewis' (1969) pathbreaking analysis of convention in terms of game theory focuses on coordination problems, and cannot accommodate partial conflict problems. In this paper, I propose a new game-theoretic definition of convention which generalizes previous game-theoretic definitions (Lewis ...

The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, designed to protect the best interests of the child in intercountry adoption, has been signed by 83 nations. We evaluate both the strengths and the weaknesses of the Convention in achieving this purpose and also in protecting a second vulnerable population, birth families. A case study example of the United States’ implementation of the Hague requirements reveals several weaknesses with respect to non-Convention countries as sending nations, financial oversight, and oversight of foreign collaborators.
